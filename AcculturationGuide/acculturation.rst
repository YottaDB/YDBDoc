Acculturation Workshop Expectations
-----------------------------------

The Acculturation Workshop is a hands-on “boot camp” for those interested in the configuration, administration and operation of applications on YottaDB. This file is the script (or workbook) for the workshop, consisting of the exercises below.

At the end of these exercises, you will have a basic working knowledge of the essential aspects of YottaDB Administration and Operation. While this workshop alone will not by any means make you a YottaDB expert, the basic working knowledge it will give you will help you to quickly understand the concepts explained in the user documentation and put you on the path to becoming an expert.

The workshop is not a course in programming with YottaDB. Familiarity with Linux® (or at least UNIX®) will allow you to move faster through the material, but is not absolutely required. If you have no experience whatsoever with Linux or UNIX, supplementary tutorial material on the side will increase your level of comfort.

-------------
YottaDB
-------------

`YottaDB <http://yottadb.com>`_ is a language-agnostic, `hierarchical key-value, NoSQL database <https://yottadb.com/product/how-it-works/>`_ engine developed and released by YottaDB LLC. For historical reasons a key-value relationship such as :code:`["^Population","Belgium",13670000]` can be written as :code:`^Population("Belgium")=13670000` and referred to as a *global variable node*, with :code:`^Population` referred to as a *global variable*. The caret (:code:`"^"`) at the beginning of the variable name makes it a database reference, with the node accessible to all processes accessing the database file in which the node resides and persistent beyond the lifetime of any process. [Although not relevant to the Acculturation Workshop, omitting the caret makes the variable a *local variable* which is accessible only within a process and whose lifetime is the lifetime of the process.]

As shown in the link, the nodes of a variable can also be visualized as a tree. As variable names are case-sensitive, :code:`^Population`, :code:`^population`, and :code:`^POPULATION` are all different variables.

Software is released at `https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB <https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB>`_.

YottaDB is architected with the following objectives:

- Without compromise, the robustness, security and integrity of the information entrusted to it.
- Easy access to information in the database.
- Continuity of business – YottaDB has unique functionality for the deployment of mission-critical applications that must be available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with no down time even for planned events.
- Throughput, performance and scalability to meet the needs of the largest applications.

Free support for YottaDB is available from the community on `various mailing lists and forums <https://yottadb.com/resources/communities/>`_. Support for YottaDB with assured service levels is available from YottaDB LLC on a commercial basis.

YottaDB provides:

- Full `ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID>`_ transaction semantics
- Throughput that scales to the needs of the largest applications
- Unique functionality for creating logical multi-site configurations for mission critical applications that must always be available - including availability during upgrades that involve changes to the database schema.

At the time of writing of this edition of the Acculturation Workshop, the latest YottaDB release is r1.34, on which the text and exercises are based. If there is a newer version of YottaDB when you go through the exercises, the same commands will work, but the output messages you see may vary.

.. note::

   Although the YottaDB database is language agnostic, exercises such as those involving crash recovery and replication use M code fragments (all provided to you). The reason is that simulating a crash with an open database in a known state is relatively easy with the YottaDB direct mode, but harder with code in other languages like Go and C which do not have an interactive mode. All the code fragments are simple. The :code:`halt` command exits from YottaDB direct mode to the shell. While in the real world, unplanned events like crashes happen when the database is not at a predetermined state, for the exercises, it is easier to understand YottaDB administration and operations by simulating crashes with the database in a known state.

+++++++++++++++++++++
Historical Background
+++++++++++++++++++++

YottaDB's codebase originated in the 1980s as an implementation of the ISO standard scripting & application development language M, commonly known as `MUMPS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS>`_. While YottaDB continues to support M (we are fastidious about backward compatibility, to allow existing applications to run on newer versions of YottaDB), the codebase has been continuously used and evolved over the last 30+ years, so that YottaDB today supports APIs in multiple languages. In the Acculturation Workshop, you will see code from `Go <https://golang.org>`_, `C <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>`_, `M <../ProgrammersGuide/langfeat.html>`_, `Perl <https://www.perl.org/>`_, and `Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/>`_ all accessing the same database. Between YottaDB and its upstream predecessor GT.M, the codebase is live at several of the largest real time core processing systems at any bank anywhere in the world, as well as increasingly in large electronic medical record systems. The implementation of YottaDB on the GNU/Linux operating system on x86_64 and ARM hardware is the basis of the FOSS stack for `VistA <http://worldvista.org/AboutVistA>`_.

------------------
User Documentation
------------------

YottaDB user documentation is organized into Manuals and Release Notes. Current YottaDB documentation is available on the `YottaDB Documentation page <https://yottadb.com/resources/documentation/>`_.

- Each software release has accompanying Release Notes to document changes between that release and its immediate predecessor, as well as release-specific information such as supported platforms. While a software release is frozen for all time, e.g., there will never be another YottaDB r1.22, release notes may be updated from time to time to correct and clarify the information within.
- Manuals are published periodically. The content within manuals is updated frequently, reflecting information that is current as of the latest software release.

---------
Packaging
---------

**The exercises in this workshop are carried out by booting guest virtual machines on your host computer**. A `virtual machine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine>`_ is a “computer within a computer”. A guest virtual machine can run a different operating system from that of the host computer. The host computer might itself run Linux, Windows, OS X, or another operating system and the guest can run YottaDB on Linux. "Emulation" or "virtualization" software helps you set up a guest system on a host computer. On the host computer, the disk images of the Acculturation Workshop guide look like ordinary files in the file system.

**Make sure to download the virtual machine before you begin the exercises**

.. note::

   YottaDB runs very well in containers, and indeed there are multiple Docker containers available to download, both with YottaDB and YottaDB bundled with VistA and other applications. We opted to use virtual machines for the exercises in the Acculturation Workshop because we judged that simulating and visualizing crashes, recovery, and replication would be easier with virtual machines.

-----
Linux
-----

Linux is the common name for the GNU/Linux operating system, consisting of the GNU utilities and libraries on the Linux kernel, available across the broadest range of hardware of any operating system. It is increasingly popular around the world for applications that include embedded computing (appliances); personal desktops; file, print & web servers; supercomputing; and to deploy mission critical software.

Free support for Linux is available on numerous mailing lists and electronic forums. Commercial support is widely available from multiple vendors.

The Acculturation Workshop virtual machine runs the `Debian <https://www.debian.org>`_ operating system on an x86_64 architecture.

Debian maintains a `page of books <https://www.debian.org/doc/books>`_ on Linux. The `Debian Wiki <https://wiki.debian.org/>`_ has useful reference information and having a paper copy of the `Debian Reference Card <https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/refcard/>`_ (available in several languages) would be useful for anyone not entirely comfortable with Linux.

--------------
Virtualization
--------------

The software used for virtualization and used for the examples in this document is `QEMU <https://www.qemu.org/>`_ which is available for many popular computing platforms, including Linux, Windows, and more. Instructions are provided below for Windows and Linux hosts. On Linux hosts, `kvm <https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page>`_ may be the preferred choice (kvm and QEMU provide a very similar user interface - kvm is a fork of QEMU focusing on the kernel module). `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ is another popular FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) virtualization application. There is also proprietary virtualization software. Even though the examples used below are QEMU, you should be able to use the virtualization software of your choice.

++++++++++++
Disk Formats
++++++++++++

The Acculturation Workshop is distributed as a `vmdk format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMDK>`_ disk image file that should work with most virtualization software, both FOSS and proprietary.

++++++++++++++++++++++++
Virtual Machine Download
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Download `Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.zip <https://docs.yottadb.com/AcculturationGuide/Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.zip>`_ and unzip it to access the disk image file Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.vmdk.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Virtual Machine Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Virtualization software configures virtual machines either with their own IP addresses where the network connection (wired or wireless) of the host has multiple IP addresses, or, more commonly - using network address translation (NAT). In the latter case, the network connection of the host has one IP address that it presents to the outside world, but each virtual machine has an IP address in a subnet within the host (the host acts just like a home wifi access point / router).

You will need to configure your virtual machine for outbound and inbound network access. While outbound access should require no configuration to work with either type of virtual machine network connection, inbound network access in a NAT'd environment will require a TCP port on the host to be forwarded to the virtual machine for each port at which a service on the virtual machine needs to respond. For example, each virtual machine has a secure shell (ssh) server listening at port 22 for incoming connections, and you might choose to forward port 2222 on the host to port 22 on your virtual machine.

Refer to the user documentation for your virtualization software to set up virtual machine networking so that :code:`Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.vmdk` is the disk image of the virtual machine, and port 2222 on the host is forwarded to port 22 on the guest. For example, using qemu-system-x86_64 on a Linux host, one of the following commands should work:

.. code-block:: bash

   qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cpu host -m 256 -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -hda Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.vmdk

Using kvm on a Linux host, the following command boots the vmdk image with port 2222 on the host forwarded to port 22 on the guest for ssh sessions:

.. code-block:: bash

    kvm -enable-kvm -cpu host -m 256 -display none -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -hda Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.vmdk

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Control of the Keyboard & Mouse
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you boot a guest virtual machine, booting it “headless” (i.e., without a console - no keyboard and mouse attached), means that the host always has control of the keyboard and mouse. If it is not headless, ownership of the keyboard or mouse may need to toggle between the host and guest. The software you use for virtualization determines how to transfer control.

++++++++++++++++++
Terminal Emulation
++++++++++++++++++

Even when running with a console, we recommend that you boot and minimize the virtual machine, and connect to your virtual machines with terminal sessions from a terminal emulator. On Windows, you can use a terminal emulator such as `PuTTY <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_. Linux distributions and OS X include terminal emulation.

-----------
Quick Start
-----------

With a terminal emulator, initiate an ssh connection to port 2222 on localhost and login with userid :code:`ydbuser` and password :code:`YottaDB Rocks!` (including a space and an exclamation point). For example, on Linux, you can use the command: :code:`ssh -p 2222 ydbuser@localhost` to connect as user :code:`ydbuser` to port 2222 on the host which is forwarded to port 22 on the guest.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh -p 2222 ydbuser@localhost
    Linux ydbdev 5.10.0-13-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.106-1 (2022-03-17) x86_64

    The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;
    the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the
    individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

    Last login: Mon Apr 11 17:17:04 2022 from 10.0.2.2
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$

As newer versions of packages are likely to have been released after the Acculturation Workshop virtual machine was released, run the following command once before using the virtual machine, to update to current versions of packages, remove old versions, and reboot to use the new packages.

.. code-block:: bash

    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade && sudo apt -y autoremove && sudo reboot now

You will likely be prompted for the :code:`ydbuser` password one or more times. As the command reboots the virtual machine, you will need to reconnect your ssh session.

+++++++++++++++
Install YottaDB
+++++++++++++++

- Create a temporary directory and change to it, e.g.: :code:`mkdir /tmp/tmp ; cd /tmp/tmp`
- Get the YottaDB install script: :code:`wget https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/raw/master/sr_unix/ydbinstall.sh`
- Make it executable: :code:`chmod +x ydbinstall.sh`
- Run it (omit the :code:`--verbose` option if you want less output): :code:`sudo ./ydbinstall.sh --utf8 default --verbose` (This command installs YottaDB under :code:`/usr/local/lib/`.)
- The script has a plethora of installation options, which you will not use in the Acculturation Workshop. You can query it to list the options with the :code:`--help` option, e.g., :code:`./ydbinstall.sh --help`.
- :code:`yottadb -version` provides a detailed report on the YottaDB build, e.g.,

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ yottadb -version
     YottaDB release:         r1.34
     Upstream base version:   GT.M V6.3-011
     Platform:                Linux x86_64
     Build date/time:         2022-02-23 20:57
     Build commit SHA:        f2f77cc184d9fe2e272d7b1d39b64434e9769804
     $

+++++++++++
Run YottaDB
+++++++++++

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As YottaDB needs a working environment and several environment variables to be set correctly, the :code:`ydb_env_set` script creates a working environment if one does not exist (defaulting to :code:`$HOME/.yottadb` unless the environment variable :code:`ydb_dir` points to another location), and sets up a default directory structure under it, with reasonable values for environment variables. You can use :code:`pkg-config` to source :code:`ydb_env_set` from the currently installed YottaDB release to start using YottaDB immediately. You can query YottaDB to identify the release, e.g.,

.. code-block:: bash

 ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ source $(pkg-config --variable=prefix yottadb)/ydb_env_set
 ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ yottadb -run %xcmd 'write $zyrelease,!'
 YottaDB r1.34 Linux x86_64
 ydbuser@ydbdev:~$

When you set up environments in YottaDB, you will set up your own scripting, but the default is a good place to start.

The :code:`tree` program shows the environment sourcing :code:`ydb_env_set` creates.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ tree .yottadb/
    .yottadb/
    ├── V6.3-011_x86_64 -> r1.34_x86_64

	│   └── yottadb.mjl
	├── o
	│   └── utf8
	└── r

    7 directories, 5 files
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$

We will explore the environment in more detail below.

+++++++++++++
Using YottaDB
+++++++++++++

Now that YottaDB is installed and configured, change to the :code:`$ydb_dir` directory (:code:`$HOME/.yottadb` in this example), and verify that the database has no nodes of the :code:`^hello` global variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ cd $ydb_dir
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~/.yottadb$ mupip extract -format=zwr -label="Hello" -select=hello -stdout
    %YDB-W-NOSELECT, None of the selected variables exist -- halting
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~/.yottadb$

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Access from C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

YottaDB comes with a `C API <../MultiLangProgGuide/cprogram.html>`_ and all you need to use it is the :code:`gcc` compiler, which is included in the virtual machine. Download the `sayhelloC.c <./sayhelloC.c>`_ program into the :code:`ydbuser` directory, compile it and run it. Notice that it has set a node in the database (the MUPIP EXTRACT command prints database contents):

.. code-block:: bash

    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ ls -l
    total 68
    -rw-r--r-- 1 ydbuser ydbuser   262 May  6 17:24 sayhelloC.c
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 ydbuser ydbuser 61779 May 10 08:53 ydbinstall.sh
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ gcc $(pkg-config --libs --cflags yottadb) -o sayhelloC sayhelloC.c -lyottadb
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ ls -l
    total 88
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 ydbuser ydbuser 16608 May 10 08:59 sayhelloC
    -rw-r--r-- 1 ydbuser ydbuser   262 May  6 17:24 sayhelloC.c
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 ydbuser ydbuser 61779 May 10 08:53 ydbinstall.sh
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ ./sayhelloC
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ mupip extract -format=zwr -label="Hello label" -select=hello -stdout
    Hello label UTF-8
    10-MAY-2022  09:00:05 ZWR
    ^hello("C")="Hello, world!"
    %YDB-I-RECORDSTAT, ^hello:        Key cnt: 1  max subsc len: 10  max rec len: 13  max node len: 27
    %YDB-I-RECORDSTAT, TOTAL:         Key cnt: 1  max subsc len: 10  max rec len: 13  max node len: 27
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Access from Go
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Accessing YottaDB from Go <../MultiLangProgGuide/goprogram.html>`_ requires the Go :code:`yottadb` package to be downloaded and installed, to provide a YottaDB Go “wrapper”. After installing the Go wrapper, you can run a test to ensure that it was installed successfully:

.. code-block:: bash

    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ go get lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ go build lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ go get -t lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ go test lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb
    ok      lang.yottadb.com/go/yottadb     5.259s
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$

Download the `sayhelloGo.go <./sayhelloGo.go>`_ program into the :code:`ydbuser` directory, compile it and run it. Notice that it too has set a node in the database:

.. code-block:: bash

    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ go build sayhelloGo.go
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ ./sayhelloGo
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ mupip extract -format=zwr -label="Hello" -select=hello -stdout
    Hello UTF-8
    10-MAY-2022  09:03:06 ZWR
    ^hello("C")="Hello, world!"
    ^hello("Go")="สวัสดีชาวโลก"
    %YDB-I-RECORDSTAT, ^hello:        Key cnt: 2  max subsc len: 11  max rec len: 36  max node len: 44
    %YDB-I-RECORDSTAT, TOTAL:         Key cnt: 2  max subsc len: 11  max rec len: 36  max node len: 44
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~$

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Access from M
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

YottaDB includes a complete language implementation for M. Download the `sayhelloM.m <./sayhelloM.m>`_ program into the :code:`.yottadb/r` directory and run it (there is no need for a separate compilation step, as there was for C and Go):

.. code-block:: bash

    ydbuser@ydbdev:~/.yottadb$ ls -l r
    total 4
    -rw-r--r-- 1 ydbuser ydbuser 57 May  6 17:24 sayhelloM.m
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~/.yottadb$ yottadb -run sayhelloM
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~/.yottadb$ mupip extract -format=zwr -label="Hello" -select=hello -stdout
    Hello UTF-8
    12-APR-2022  10:46:56 ZWR
    ^hello("C")="Hello, world!"
    ^hello("Go")="สวัสดีชาวโลก"
    ^hello("M")="Привіт Світ"
    %YDB-I-RECORDSTAT, ^hello:        Key cnt: 3  max subsc len: 11  max rec len: 36  max node len: 44
    %YDB-I-RECORDSTAT, TOTAL:         Key cnt: 3  max subsc len: 11  max rec len: 36  max node len: 44
    ydbuser@ydbdev:~/.yottadb$

Notice that after running it, YottaDB has automatically compiled the source code (:code:`sayhelloM.m`) and created a file with object code (:code:`sayhelloM.o`) which it dynamically links and runs.

.. code-block:: bash

    ydbuser@ydbdev:~/.yottadb$ tree

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Access from Node.js
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

YottaDB can be accessed from Node.js using `Nodem <https://github.com/dlwicksell/nodem>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ npm install nodem

Download the `sayhelloNode.js <./sayhelloNode.js>`_ example into the :code:`ydbuser` directory and run it. It will add another node in the database.

.. code-block:: bash

----------
Journaling
----------

You should journal any database files whose integrity you care about. Conversely, you need not journal any database file that you are prepared to delete & recreate anew in the event of an unclean shutdown, like a system crash.

YottaDB uses journaling (called “logging” by some databases) to restore data integrity and provide continuity of business after an unplanned event such as a system crash. There are two switches to turn on journaling – ENABLE / DISABLE and ON / OFF. Enabling or disabling journaling requires stand alone access to the database. Turning journaling on and off can be done when the database is in use.

+++++++++++++++++++++
Exercise - Journaling
+++++++++++++++++++++

In this exercise, you will crash your virtual machine and then recover the database. As sourcing the :code:`ydb_env_set` file does all the setup that you need, and recovers the database, you will not learn the underlying operation of the database if you use it. Instead, you will create a small file that explicitly sets environment variables. The exercise has two parts, preparing the directory for the exercise, to be done once, and then crashing and recovery, which you can do as often as you want.

~~~~~~~~~~~
Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a directory with a name like :code:`jnlex` (for journaling exercises) or other prefered name and change to that directory. Create a file to source that sets required environment variables and convenient aliases (:code:`nano` and :code:`vi` editors are installed on the virtual machine; you can install your preferred editor: for example to install a character-mode emacs, run :code:`sudo apt install emacs-nox`). Although the code fragments are M code, they are straightforward, and you can use equivalent code from other languages if you prefer.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ cat jnlex_env
   export ydb_dist=$(pkg-config --variable=prefix yottadb)
   export ydb_routines=". $ydb_dist/libyottadbutil.so"
   alias yottadb=$ydb_dist/yottadb
   alias mupip=$ydb_dist/mupip
   export ydb_dir=$HOME/jnlex
   export ydb_gbldir=$ydb_dir/ydb.gld
   export ydb_chset=utf-8
   export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
   export ydb_icu_version=$(pkg-config --modversion icu-io)
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ source jnlex_env
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$

Create a global directory with the Global Directory Editor (GDE) utility (see :ref:`gbl-dir-gbl-var` below), and a database file. Turn on journaling for the database file.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ yottadb -run GDE
   %GDE-I-GDUSEDEFS, Using defaults for Global Directory
	   /home/ydbuser/jnlex/ydb.gld

   GDE> exit

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ mupip set -journal=enable,on,before -region DEFAULT
   %YDB-I-JNLCREATE, Journal file /home/ydbuser/jnlex/ydb.mjl created for region DEFAULT with BEFORE_IMAGES
   %YDB-I-JNLSTATE, Journaling state for region DEFAULT is now ON
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Crashing and Recovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start by cleaning out old journal files. Verify that there are no shared memory segments (if there are any, reboot the virtual machine). Then go into YottaDB's direct (interactive) mode, perform a database operation, and verify that there is now a new shared memory segment.

.. note::

   For those who are not familiar with M, :code:`$horolog` is a comma separated string consisting of the number of days since December 31, 1840, and the number of seconds since midnight in the time zone of the process, and :code:`$zdate()` converts :code:`$horolog` format timestamps to friendlier formats.

Now simulate a crash by killing the virtual machine by clicking on the “X” of the console window, or with a :code:`kill -9` of the virtual machine process on the host. It is important that you kill the virtual machine with the database open by the :code:`yottadb` process, because otherwise the process will shut down the database cleanly on exit and you will not simulate a crash with an open database file.

Reboot the virtual machine, change to the :code:`jnlex` directory, source the :code:`jnlex_env` and attempt to access the data. Note the error because the database was not cleanly shut down.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ cd jnlex/
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ source jnlex_env
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ yottadb -run %XCMD 'zwrite ^X'
   %YDB-E-REQRECOV, Error accessing database /home/ydbuser/jnlex/ydb.dat.  Must be recovered on cluster node ydbdev.
   %YDB-I-TEXT, Error with database control shmctl
   %SYSTEM-E-ENO22, Invalid argument
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$

Now recover the database, and note that the database update you made is in the database.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ mupip journal -recover -backward "*"
   %YDB-I-MUJNLSTAT, Initial processing started at Tue Apr 12 12:20:09 2022

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ yottadb -run %XCMD 'zwrite ^X'
   ^X="APR 12, 2022"
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$

Notice that the recovery renamed the previous journal file (from :code:`ydb.mjl` to :code:`ydb.mjl_2022102122009` - :code:`2022102122009` is a timestamp representing 12:20:09 on the 102\ :sup:`nd`\  day of 2022), and created a new journal file :code:`ydb.mjl`.

Practice crashing the virtual machine with an open database several times till you get the hang of recovery after a crash.

Look at the animation of journaling in action at the beginning of `Chapter 6: YottaDB Journaling <../AdminOpsGuide/ydbjournal.html#journal-files>`_ in the Administration and Operations Guide.

.. note::

   Robust operation of YottaDB recovery after a crash requires robust recovery of the file system. If your file system requires an option to ensure that meta-data is written to disk only after the corresponding data is written, ensure that it is set. Also, if you are running in a virtual machine or container, ensure that it is configured so that when the guest does a “sync” to commit data to the file system, the host commits the data to the underlying persistent storage.

.. _gbl-dir-gbl-var:

--------------------------------------------
Global Directories Point to Global Variables
--------------------------------------------

Global variables reside in  database files. Given a person's name, a telephone directory helps you find the person by giving you their phone number, and sometimes their address as well. Analogously, a global directory helps a YottaDB process find a global variable node by pointing it to the database file where that node resides. *While the most common, and efficient, use case has an entire global variable  residing in a database file, YottaDB permits subtrees of a global variable to reside in different database files.*

The global directory is a binary file pointed to by the intrinsic special variable :code:`$zgbldir` (an *intrinsic special variable* or ISV starts with a :code:`$` and names are case-insensitive). At process start-up, :code:`$zgbldir` is initialized from the environment variable :code:`ydb_gbldir`; a process may change global directories as it executes by setting :code:`$zgbldir` to different global directory files.

The GDE utility program (invoked from the shell with :code:`yottadb -run ^GDE`) is used to manage global directories.

.. note::

   The input to GDE can be a text file. In a production environment, YottaDB recommends that text files be used to define database configurations, and that these text files be put under version control.

Although there is a `GUI for GDE <https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/UI/YDBGDEGUI>`_, for the Acculturation Workshop we will use text files as the workshop is intended to develop low-level YottaDB skills.

In YottaDB, sets of M global variables (Names or Name spaces) are mapped to Regions that define properties relating to the M global. Each Region is mapped to a Segment that defines properties relating to the file system. Consider the example in the figure below:

.. image:: globaldir.svg

In this example, there are four M global variables that we would like to separate from the rest (e.g., for purposes of sharing globals between applications, or for reasons of protection – perhaps they contain special information, so that only mammalogists are to have access to globals ^Horse and ^Platypus, and only carcinologists are to have access to globals ^Crab and ^Lobster). This is accomplished by creating five name spaces (note that a name space can contain a single variable, as in this example, or a range of global variables, e.g., everything starting with ^A through ^Horse). There is always a default (:code:`*`) name space.

One or more name spaces are mapped to a Region. All global variables in a region share a common set of M global variable properties, such as the maximum record length, whether null subscripts are permitted, etc. In this case ^Horse and ^Platypus are mapped to the region MAMMALS, whereas ^Crab and ^Lobster are mapped to the region CRUSTACEANS. The default name space * is mapped to a region called DEFAULT (while region names are case insensitive, they are frequently written in upper case).

Each region is mapped to a Segment. Just as a region defines properties pertaining to M global variables, the segment defines properties pertaining to the database file for that region, such as the file name, the initial allocation, number of global buffers, etc. The database file is just an ordinary file in the file system of the underlying operating system.

Each database file can have a single active journal file. A journal file can be linked to its predecessor to form a chain of journal files.

The intrinsic special variable :code:`$zgbldir` points a YottaDB process to the global directory. :code:`$zgbldir` is initialized from the environment variable :code:`ydb_gbldir` at process startup, but it can be modified by the process during execution. Assuming you have sourced the :code:`jnlex_env` file:

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ yottadb -run %XCMD 'write $zgbldir,!'
   /home/ydbuser/jnlex/ydb.gld
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$

GDE, the Global Directory Editor, is a program used to manipulate global directories. Before using it, add an extra line to the :code:`jnlex_env` file to allow you to  recall the last line typed, in case you make a mistake and want to recall and edit the previous line:

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ cat jnlex_env
   export ydb_dist=$(pkg-config --variable=prefix yottadb)
   export ydb_routines=". $ydb_dist/libyottadbutil.so"
   alias yottadb=$ydb_dist/yottadb
   alias mupip=$ydb_dist/mupip
   export ydb_dir=$HOME/jnlex
   export ydb_gbldir=$ydb_dir/ydb.gld
   export ydb_chset=utf-8
   export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
   export ydb_icu_version=$(pkg-config --modversion icu-io)
   export ydb_principal_editing=EDITING
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ source jnlex_env
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ yottadb -run GDE
   %GDE-I-LOADGD, Loading Global Directory file
	   /home/ydbuser/jnlex/ydb.gld
   %GDE-I-VERIFY, Verification OK


   GDE>

You can use the show command to examine name spaces, regions and segments.

.. code-block:: bash

   GDE> show -name

	    *** NAMES ***
    Global                             Region
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *                                  DEFAULT
   GDE>

In this case, there is only one name space, the default. There is also only one region, DEFAULT. Region and segment names are case insensitive, but name spaces are case sensitive, since M variable names are case sensitive.

.. code-block:: bash

   GDE> show -region

				   *** REGIONS ***

   GDE>

Notice the region parameters – review them in the `Region Qualfiers section of the Administration and Operations Guide <../AdminOpsGuide/gde.html#region-qualifiers>`_. Since there is one region, there is also one segment, also called DEFAULT. (Although the region and segment names can be different; it is good practice to keep them the same).

.. code-block:: bash

Notice how the database file is defined using the environment variable :code:`ydb_dir`. Using environment variables allows multiple processes to share a global directory, with different processes referring to different database files, depending on environment variable values.

.. note::

    The parameters in the global directory are used only by :code:`mupip create` to create a new database file. At other times, the global directory is used only to map global variable names to database files. So, if you change the global directory, existing database files are not changed. If you change a parameter in a database file, unless you also change the global directory used to create the database file, the next time you create that file, it will use old parameters in the global directory.

The :code:`show -map` command gives visualization of the mapping of names to database files in the global directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   GDE> show -map

Of course, this global directory is not very interesting as all global variables map to a single region. There are many reasons why one might want a multi-region database, including but not limited to:

- Database size: A single database file is limited to 992Mi [#]_ blocks, which with the common block size of 4Ki bytes, translates to a database of 3,968 Gi bytes, not including the file header. A database consists of one or more database files, and while there is a theoretical YottaDB limit on the number of database files, it is so large that all practical limits are those of the underlying storage.
- Access control: As YottaDB uses the standard user-group-world model of access control (which may be further refined by Mandatory Access Controls; see `YottaDB Security Philosophy <../AdminOpsGuide/securityph.html>`_), database file ownership and permissions can be used for access control (see :ref:`security` below). For example, mammalogists might have read-write access to database files that store information about mammals, while giving carcinologists read-only access, with carcinologists doing tthe reverse for database files that store information about crustaceans.
- Performance: Since the granularity of critical sections for committing updates is the database region, database "hot spots" can be reduced by configuring databases to map different global variables to different database files. Note however, that when using transaction processing, as concurrent critical sections are needed for all global variables updated in a transaction, it would improve peformance to map related globals to the same region.
- Manageability: Related information can be placed in a single database file. For example, Internet of Things (IoT) application stacks often include a cloud service that complements edge devices. Such a cloud service might be configured to map the data for each edge device in a separate database file.

.. [#]  YottaDB uses prefixes like Ki & Mi for binary prefixes, and K and M for decimal & prefixes whose bases are not specified.

Let's make the single region database a little more interesting.

Exercise - Separate Regions for Mammalogists and Carcinologists
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Continue using the directory you created for the journaling exercise.

While not essential, it may be conceptually helpful to build the global directory from the bottom up – first create the segments, then the regions, and then the name spaces.

.. code-block:: bash

   GDE> add -segment MAMMALS -file_name=$ydb_dir/linnaeus.dat
   GDE> add -segment CRUSTACEANS -file_name=$ydb_dir/brunnich.dat
   GDE> show -segment

				   *** SEGMENTS ***
    Segment                         File (def ext: .dat)Acc Typ Block      Alloc Exten Options

							BG  DYN  4096        100   100 GLOB=1024
										       LOCK= 220
										       RES =   0
										       ENCR= OFF
										       MSLT=1024
										       DALL= YES
										       AIO = OFF
    DEFAULT                         $ydb_dir/ydb.dat    BG  DYN  4096        100   100 GLOB=1024
										       LOCK= 220
										       RES =   0
										       ENCR= OFF
										       MSLT=1024
										       DALL= YES
										       AIO = OFF
    MAMMALS                         $ydb_dir/linnaeus.dat
							BG  DYN  4096        100   100 GLOB=1024
										       LOCK= 220
										       RES =   0
										       ENCR= OFF
										       MSLT=1024
										       DALL= YES
										       AIO = OFF
   GDE>

Then we can map the regions to the segments. Notice that even though the segment names (specified with the :code:`-dynamic` qualifier) are entered in lower case, they are converted to and displayed in upper case.

.. code-block:: bash

   GDE> add -region MAMMALS -dynamic=mammals
   GDE> add -region CRUSTACEANS -dynamic=crustaceans
   GDE> show -region

    DEFAULT                         DEFAULT                            0      256    64 NEVER     Y    N   N      N     Y     N      Y     Sep

   GDE>

Now map the name spaces to the regions.

.. code-block:: bash

   GDE> add -name Horse -region=MAMMALS
   GDE> add -name Platypus -region=MAMMALS
   GDE> add -name Crab -region=CRUSTACEANS
   GDE> add -name Lobster -region=CRUSTACEANS
   GDE> show -name

	    *** NAMES ***

You can examine the entire map, and ask GDE to perform a check for consistency.

To interpret the above, the first column is the first global variable residing in a region, and the second is the next global variable not in the region, i.e., the region is all global variables starting with the first, and up to, but not including the second.

- The entry with :code:`%` in the first column and :code:`Crab` in the second means all global variables starting with and including :code:`^%` (the first global variable) up to, but not including :code:`^Crab` are mapped to region and segment :code:`DEFAULT` and the file :code:`$ydb_dir/ydb.dat`.
- Since :code:`^Crab0` is the next global variable name after :code:`^Crab`, the next entry states that the global variable :code:`^Crab` is mapped to region and segment :code:`MAMMALS` and the file :code:`$ydb_dir/linneaus.dat`.

Exiting GDE creates the global directory. You can then use a MUPIP CREATE command to create the database files. Notice that journal files must be separately created.

.. code-block:: bash

   GDE> exit
   %GDE-I-VERIFY, Verification OK

   %GDE-I-GDUPDATE, Updating Global Directory file
	   /home/ydbuser/jnlex/ydb.gld
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$

Now create database files using :code:`mupip create` (notice that it creates two new database files, and tells you that one file already exists), and turn on journaling for the newly created database files

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ mupip create
   %YDB-I-DBFILECREATED, Database file $ydb_dir/brunnich.dat created
   %YDB-E-DBOPNERR, Error opening database file /home/ydbuser/jnlex/ydb.dat
   %SYSTEM-E-ENO17, File exists
   %YDB-I-DBFILECREATED, Database file /home/ydbuser/jnlex/linnaeus.dat created
   %YDB-F-DBNOCRE, Not all specified database files, or their associated journal files were created
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ mupip set -journal=enable,on,before -region CRUSTACEANS,MAMMALS
   %YDB-I-JNLCREATE, Journal file /home/ydbuser/jnlex/brunnich.mjl created for region CRUSTACEANS with BEFORE_IMAGES
   %YDB-I-JNLSTATE, Journaling state for region CRUSTACEANS is now ON
   %YDB-I-JNLCREATE, Journal file /home/ydbuser/jnlex/linnaeus.mjl created for region MAMMALS with BEFORE_IMAGES
   %YDB-I-JNLSTATE, Journaling state for region MAMMALS is now ON
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$

For production environments, we suggest that you put your GDE commands in a text file and invoke them with a heredoc or using GDE's @ command. Put the text file under version control.

Recovering a multi-region database after a crash is no different than recovering a single region database.

Now crash and reboot the virtual machine and again note the inability to open any database region.

Recover the database using exactly the same command as before, and note that it recovers three regions, and you are now able to access all three regions of the database file

--------------------------
No Daemon to Start or Stop
--------------------------

YottaDB has no special startup or shut down. The first process to open a database file sets up all the shared memory segment and control structures needed for database operation. The last one out cleans up and releases the shared memory. There is no daemon that needs to run with elevated privileges or can be a single point of failure, a performance bottleneck or a potential security vulnerability.

Upon bringing the system back up from a crash or unclean shutdown (shutdown with open database files):

* For database regions that are not journaled, delete the database files and create new files
* Database regions that are journaled using before image journaling (the type in the exercises above) are recovered using the databases with the MUPIP JOURNAL RECOVER BACKWARD command.
* Database regions that are journaled using nobefore image journaling are recovered by restoring a backup and using the MUPIP JOURNAL RECOVER FORWARD command.
* Database regions that constitute replicated instances (see :ref:`db-repl`) are recovered using the MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK rather than MUPIP JOURNAL RECOVER.

In all cases using journaling, the recovery point after a crash is the same - the last update in the journal files.

--------------------------
Environment Variables
--------------------------

The operation of YottaDB is controlled by a number of environment variables, described in the `YottaDB Administration and Operations Guide <../AdminOpsGuide/basicops.html#env-vars>`_.

- The most important one is :code:`ydb_gbldir`, discussed above, which allows a process to access a global directory, which in turn allows it to access the database (global variables).

- :code:`ydb_dir`, defaulting to :code:`$HOME/.yottadb` if not set, is used by :code:`ydb_env_set` to create a directory in a standard configuration for using YottaDB. Note that a directory in a standard configuration is just a convenience, as the environment variables allow YottaDB database files and routines to be placed just about anywhere on a system

- Using YottaDB requires language specific environment variables

    - Environment variables for M programs include:

      - The required :code:`ydb_routines` environment variable provides a search path for YottaDB to execute M programs.
      - An optional :code:`ydb_chset` environment variable to determine whether a process should operate in M mode or UTF-8 mode (defaulting to M mode). To choose UTF-8 mode, this must be set before sourcing :code:`ydb_env_set` and a locale that is installed on the system must also be defined, e.g.: :code:`export ydb_chset=UTF-8 LC_CTYPE=C.utf8`

    - Other languages will require their own environment variables.

- The :code:`ydb_dist` environment variable points to the location where YottaDB is installed. If not set, YottaDB will set it so that code in the process, and child processes, can easily locate the directory where YottaDB is installed.

The file :code:`ydb_env_set` that is supplied with YottaDB, and which must be sourced rather than executed, attempts to provide reasonable default values:

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ env | grep ^ydb
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~$ source $(pkg-config --variable=prefix yottadb)/ydb_env_set

   :code:`ydb_unset_822` and :code:`ydb_sav_822_PATH` above are used when sourcing the :code:`ydb_env_unset` file to restore environment variables set by sourcing :code:`ydb_env_set`; the 822 is the pid of the shell.

While :code:`ydb_env_set` is a good resource when you initially start with YottaDB, once you get to a certain level of expertise, you may prefer to create your own scripting.

Security
--------

YottaDB was designed from the very beginning to be secure.

.. note::

   Absolute security does not exist in this universe. For a discussion that bridges philosophy and technology, we highly recommend `Bruce Schneier's Secrets and Lies, ISBN 0-471-25311-1 <http://www.schneier.com/book-sandl.html>`_.

A YottaDB process can access a database file only if the file ownership and permissions allow it to do so. The YottaDB security model is simple, well understood and documented. See also the `YottaDB Security Philosophy <../AdminOpsGuide/securityph.html>`_.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Exercise - Access Controls with Ownership and Permissions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the following, Linux file permissions are used to allow the owner to read and write all database files, and another user to have read-only access to a database file, and no access whatsoever to another database file. Change the permissions as shown, and make updates. Note that existing data in the database is added to, as this exercise is being created on a different date from the journaling exercise. If you do both exercises on the same day, your data will be overwritten. As before, this uses the YottaDB direct mode to set the variables and then loop through the variable names dumping the values. You can write code in a programming language of your choice or you can copy and paste the M commands from here in your shell session.

There is an installation option to restrict access to YottaDB to a group. If you use this option, only those in the specified group will be able to use YottaDB.

.. _db-repl:

----------------------
Database Replication
----------------------

When an application must have the best possible continuity of business, use database replication in addition to before-image journaling to create a logical multi-site configuration. Unlike techniques like high-availability clustering that have a single point of failure (the cluster hardware and software), YottaDB replication uses “share nothing” logical multi-site instances with no single point of failure.

Furthermore, YottaDB database replication can be used to provide continuous application availability in the face of not just unplanned events, such as system crashes, but also planned events like application and system upgrades, and even most upgrades that involve application schema changes. Database replication has functionality beyond business continuity, as discussed in the `Database Replication chapter of the Administration and Operations Guide <../AdminOpsGuide/dbrepl.html>`_.

The restriction of YottaDB replication today is the 20,000 kilometer distance limit on replication (since the circumference of Planet Earth is approximately 40,000 kilometers, it is difficult to place data centers more than 20,000 kilometers apart). In our example, we will simulate data centers in Santiago (33°S, 70°W), Paris (49°N, 2°E) and Melbourne (37°S, 144°E). Santiago to Paris is 11,642 kilometers, Paris to Melbourne is 16,781 kilometers, and Melbourne to Santiago is 11,269 kilometers (approximately).

Exercise - Replication
++++++++++++++++++++++

Because replication builds on journaling, use the :code:`jnlex` directory created above. Enhance the :code:`jnlex_env` shell script to assign values to two more environment variables, :code:`ydb_repl_instance` and :code:`ydb_repl_instname`. :code:`ydb_repl_instance` is the name of a file where a replicated instance stores information about the state of replication and :code:`ydb_repl_instname` is the name of an instance – in this case, :code:`dummy`, but we will change it as we create copies of the instances.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$ cat jnlex_env
   export ydb_dist=$(pkg-config --variable=prefix yottadb)
   export ydb_routines=". $ydb_dist/libyottadbutil.so"
   alias yottadb=$ydb_dist/yottadb
   alias mupip=$ydb_dist/mupip
   export ydb_dir=$HOME/jnlex
   export ydb_gbldir=$ydb_dir/ydb.gld
   export ydb_chset=utf-8
   export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
   export ydb_icu_version=$(pkg-config --modversion icu-io)
   export ydb_principal_editing=EDITING
   export ydb_repl_instance=$ydb_dir/ydb.repl
   export ydb_repl_instname=dummy
   ydbuser@ydbdev:~/jnlex$

After sourcing :code:`jnlex_env` to set the environment variables first, turn on replication. This will create a new set of journal files without a link to the prior journal files, as the journal formats differ for replicated vs. unreplicated database regions.

Processes in replicated instances write updates to a shared memory segment called a Journal Pool

Shut down the Acculturation Workshop virtual machine cleanly and make three copies of the Acculturation Workshop called Paris.vmdk, Melbourne.vmdk and Santiago.vmdk. Alternatively, if your host system is short of disk space, make two copies and rename the original Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.vmdk file.

If you are using qcow2 or vmdk disk images with QEMU/kvm on Linux, you can use a feature that allows a disk image to be created off a base image so that the base image does not change and all changes go to the new disk image. Check with your virtualization software to determine whether it supports this feature. Execute commands such as the following on the host (with the guest shut down) – depending on the version of QEMU/kvm on your PC, the exact command may vary.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ qemu-img create -f vmdk -o zeroed_grain,backing_file=Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.vmdk Melbourne.vmdk
   Formatting 'Melbourne.vmdk', fmt=vmdk size=107374182400 backing_file=Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.vmdk compat6=off hwversion=undefined zeroed_grain=on
   $ qemu-img create -f vmdk -o zeroed_grain,backing_file=Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.vmdk Paris.vmdk
   Formatting 'Paris.vmdk', fmt=vmdk size=107374182400 backing_file=Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.vmdk compat6=off hwversion=undefined zeroed_grain=on
   $ qemu-img create -f vmdk -o zeroed_grain,backing_file=Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.vmdk Santiago.vmdk
   Formatting 'Santiago.vmdk', fmt=vmdk size=107374182400 backing_file=Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.vmdk compat6=off hwversion=undefined zeroed_grain=on
   $ ls -l *.vmdk
   -rw-r--r-- 1 bhaskar gtc 9320071168 Apr 12 17:22 Debian-11_yottadbworkshop.vmdk
   -rw-r--r-- 1 bhaskar gtc   13172736 Apr 12 17:24 Melbourne.vmdk
   -rw-r--r-- 1 bhaskar gtc   13172736 Apr 12 17:24 Paris.vmdk
   -rw-r--r-- 1 bhaskar gtc   13172736 Apr 12 17:24 Santiago.vmdk
   $

Now boot the three virtual machines. Each virtual machine will need two ports to be forwarded from the host, one for ssh access forwarded to port 22 on each virtual machine and one for replication forwarded to port 3000 on each virtual machine (i.e., a total of six ports on the host for the three instances). The examples here use host ports 2221 & 4000 for Santiago, 2222 & 5000 for Paris, and 2223 & 6000 for Melbourne. The commands given here use kvm on Linux – use the commands appropriate to virtualization on your host).

.. code-block:: bash

   kvm -enable-kvm -cpu host -m 256 -display none -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2221-:22,hostfwd=tcp::4000-:3000 -hda Santiago.vmdk &
   kvm -enable-kvm -cpu host -m 256 -display none -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22,hostfwd=tcp::5000-:3000 -hda Paris.vmdk &
   kvm -enable-kvm -cpu host -m 256 -display none -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2223-:22,hostfwd=tcp::6000-:3000 -hda Melbourne.vmdk &

To avoid confusion when you are working with multiple machines, change the name of each machine from :code:`ydbdev` to its location. The examples here are from the Santiago machine. You should do likewise with Paris and Melbourne. To effect a name change you will need to (as root) edit the files :code:`/etc/hosts` and :code:`/etc/hostname` to change :code:`ydbdev` to :code:`santiago` and then reboot.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@santiago:~$ cat /etc/hostname
   santiago
   ydbuser@santiago:~$ cat /etc/hosts
   127.0.0.1       localhost
   127.0.1.1       santiago.yottadb.com    santiago

   # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
   ::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
   ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
   ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
   ydbuser@santiago:~$

You may also want to change the window/tab labels on your terminal emulator on the host to show which machine each session is connected to.

To make it more realistic (and to reduce the probability of operator error) on each machine, execute :code:`sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata` to specify the “local” time zone.

On each machine, edit :code:`jnlex_env` in each instance and change the line :code:`export ydb_repl_instname=dummy` and the line :code:`export ydb_repl_instance=$ydb_dir/ydb.repl` to an instance file name for that instance. For example, on the Santiago instance:

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@santiago:~/jnlex$ cat jnlex_env
   export ydb_dist=$(pkg-config --variable=prefix yottadb)
   export ydb_routines=$ydb_dist/libyottadbutil.so
   alias yottadb=$ydb_dist/yottadb
   alias mupip=$ydb_dist/mupip
   export ydb_dir=$HOME/jnlex
   export ydb_gbldir=$ydb_dir/ydb.gld
   export ydb_chset=utf-8
   export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
   export ydb_icu_version=$(pkg-config --modversion icu-io)
   export ydb_principal_editing=EDITING
   export ydb_repl_instance=$ydb_dir/santiago.repl
   export ydb_repl_instname=santiago
   ydbuser@santiago:~/jnlex$

Then on each instance, create a replication instance file. From Santiago, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@santiago:~/jnlex$ source jnlex_env
   ydbuser@santiago:~/jnlex$ ls -l *.repl
   ls: cannot access '*.repl': No such file or directory
   ydbuser@santiago:~/jnlex$ mupip replicate -instance_create
   ydbuser@santiago:~/jnlex$ ls -l *.repl
   -rw-r--r-- 1 ydbuser ydbuser 2048 Apr 13 11:57 santiago.repl
   ydbuser@santiago:~/jnlex$

Start the configuration with Paris as the originating primary instance, and Santiago and Melbourne in replicating secondary roles. The following commands, on the three instances can be executed in any order.

Start Santiago as a replicating instance.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ yottadb -dir

   YDB>set ^Weather("Paris",$Piece($Horolog,",",1),$Piece($Horolog,",",2))="Rainy"

   YDB>

Verify that the data is replicated at Santiago and Melbourne. Execute the following at both instances:

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@melbourne:~/jnlex$ yottadb -dir

   YDB>zwrite ^Weather
   ^Weather("Paris",66212,78729)="Rainy"

Now, simulate an unplanned outage of Paris by clicking on the “X” of the virtual machine console window, kill -9 of the process on the host, or otherwise powering down the virtual machine. Make Melbourne the new originating instance and Santiago its replicating instance. When an instance in a primary role goes down, YottaDB does not automatically bring up another instance in a primary role. As YottaDB does not have visibility of network status, a YottaDB instance in a secondary role cannot distinguish between a crashed primary and a network blip or outage that disrupts communication between it and the primary instance. YottaDB instances must be told whether to come up in a primary role or a secondary role.

.. note::

   In a controlled switchover/planned outage, bringing down the originating primary first helps to ensure that you do not have two concurrently operating originating primary instances.

Bring down Melbourne as a replicating instance and bring it up as the originating instance. Notice that you can bring up the Source Server process to replicate to Paris – it will make the connection when Paris comes up.

   ydbuser@santiago:~/jnlex$

The purpose of the MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK BACKWARD FETCHRESYNC operation is for Santiago to roll its database state back to a common state shared with Melbourne, so that when Santiago starts to operate in a secondary role to Melbourne in a primary role, and it catches up to Melbourne, the two instances are logically in the same state. Any transactions rolled off are called “lost” transactions (see :ref:`repl-bcklogs`). In this case,  no lost (unreplicated) transaction file was created as no transactions (updates) had to be rolled off to synchronize the instances.

Now reboot Paris to simulate its recovery. When the system comes up (before performing any other database access), perform a rollback fetchresync.

   YDB>set ^Weather("Melbourne",$Piece($Horolog,",",1),$Piece($Horolog,",",2))="Stormy"

And confirm that it is replicated to Santiago.

.. _repl-bcklogs:

------------------------
Replication and Backlogs
------------------------

In an ideal world, an originating instance never goes down with a backlog. In the real world, it may well go down with a backlog of updates that have not been replicated. Asynchronous replication is required for business continuity: if synchronous replication were to be used, a network outage between the primary instance and its secondary instance or instances would require the primary to stop operating.

In order to provide continuity of business, when an originating primary instance goes down, a former replicating secondary instance can be brought up as the new originating primary instance to keep the application available. When the former originating primary instance comes up, it is in a secondary role, and the updates that were part of the backlog must be handled. YottaDB provides the hooks needed to create applications that are continuously available, but the application must take advantage of these hooks. Consider the following two-instance example (the notation P: 100 means that the site is operating as the primary and has committed update number 100):

+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Santiago                     |        Melbourne                                                                                         |
+==============================+==========================================================================================================+
| P:100                        |        S:95 (backlog of 5 updates)                                                                       |
+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Crashes                      |        P:95 (becomes the originating instance, starts processing, and keeps the organization operational)|
+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Repaired and brought back up |        P:120 (processing has moved it ahead)                                                             |
+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This situation needs to be remedied, because updates (transactions) 96-100 on Santiago are different from updates 96-100 on Melbourne. This has a YottaDB part and an application software part. The YottaDB part is to rollback the transactions on the former originating primary instance with the MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK BACKWARD FETCHRESYNC command. These rolled back updates (“unreplicated” or “lost” transactions) are placed in a file and must be transmitted to the new originating instance for reprocessing/reconciliation by application logic.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Santiago                                                                        |      Melbourne                                                    |
+=================================================================================+===================================================================+
| S: 95 (database rolled back; updates 96-100 in unreplicated transaction file)   |      P:120                                                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| S: 120 (catches up with Melbourne once replication resumes)                     |      P: 120 (receives unreplicated transaction file)              |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| S: 125 (unreplicated transactions make it back after reprocessing)              |      P: 125 (processing unreplicated transactions moves it ahead) |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

Adding Paris to the example above complicates it only slightly. There are two cases to consider when Santiago crashes:

- Paris is at transaction 95 or less. In this case, Paris simply becomes a replicating instance to Melbourne and there is no need for Paris to rollback any transactions.

- Paris is at a transaction 96 or more. In this case, when Paris becomes a replicating instance to Melbourne, it performs a rollback to transaction 95 before starting replication. These transactions in the unreplicated transaction file do not need to be sent to Melbourne for reprocessing because they will be in the unreplicated transaction file from Santiago.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Exercise - Replication and Backlogs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This exercise simulates a replication with a backlog. Start with Santiago as the originating instance replicating to Paris and Melbourne as replicating instances. Since Santiago most recently was a secondary instance, you should start Melbourne and Paris with MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK BACKWARD FETCHRESYNC commands.

Start Santiago as the originating instance:

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@santiago:~/jnlex$ mupip replicate -source -start -instsecondary=paris -secondary=10.0.2.2:5000 -buffsize=1048576 -log=/home/ydbuser/jnlex/source_paris_`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`.log
   Wed Apr 13 16:24:21 2022 : Initiating START of source server for secondary instance [paris]
   ydbuser@santiago:~/jnlex$ mupip replicate -source -start -instsecondary=melbourne -secondary=10.0.2.2:6000 -buffsize=1048576 -log=/home/ydbuser/jnlex/source_melbourne_`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`.log
   Wed Apr 13 16:24:46 2022 : Initiating START of source server for secondary instance [melbourne]
   ydbuser@santiago:~/jnlex$

At Paris (and also in Melbourne) perform the FETCHRESYNC operation and then start replication. You can ask YottaDB to tell you the health of replication and also the replication backlog. The following shows the interaction in Paris; do the same in Melbourne.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ mupip journal -rollback -backward -fetchresync=3000 -losttrans=/home/ydbuser/jnlex/Unreplic_Trans_Report_`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`.txt "*"

.. note::

   There is an important difference between the MUPIP REPLICATE SOURCE SHOWBACKLOG command executed on the instance in a primary role and the MUPIP REPLICATE RECEIVER SHOWBACKLOG executed on instances in secondary roles. The former is the difference between updates (transactions) on the primary instance database and transmitted to a secondary instance or instances. This backlog is potentially the number of lost (unreplicated) transactions that will be written to a lost transaction file if the primary crashes and comes up as a secondary instance. The latter is the difference between backlogs received by an instance in a secondary role and applied to the database. In the event the secondary crashes and comes up again as the secondary, this is the number of updates that the primary will need to retransmit to the secondary instance. In an application under normal load, an operational goal is to keep the backlogs as small as possible, though it will never go to zero.

Now create an update in Santiago.

.. code-block:: bash

   YDB>set ^Weather("Santiago",$Piece($Horolog,",",1),$Piece($Horolog,",",2))="Snowing"

Verify that it is replicated in Paris and Melbourne.

.. code-block:: bash

   YDB>zwrite ^Weather
   ^Weather("Melbourne",66213,21528)="Stormy"
   ^Weather("Paris",66212,78729)="Rainy"
   ^Weather("Paris",66212,78795)="Sunny"
   ^Weather("Santiago",66212,59306)="Snowing"

Now crash Santiago. You have a choice of bringing up Paris or Melbourne. If you don't have time to make a decision as to which replicating instance to make the new primary, just choose the most convenient. If you have time to make a decision, you can see which one is further ahead by looking at the “Region Seqno” field in the database file header with DSE (in a multi-region database, you need to look at all replicated regions and take the maximum).

In Paris:

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ $ydb_dist/dse all -dump 2>&1 | grep "Region Seqno"
     Replication State                      ON  Region Seqno    0x0000000000000004
     Replication State                      ON  Region Seqno    0x0000000000000006
     Replication State                      ON  Region Seqno    0x0000000000000004
     Replication State                     OFF  Region Seqno    0x0000000000000001
     Replication State                      ON  Region Seqno    0x0000000000000004
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$

and in Melbourne:

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@melbourne:~/jnlex$ $ydb_dist/dse all -dump 2>&1 | grep "Region Seqno"
     Replication State                      ON  Region Seqno    0x0000000000000004
     Replication State                      ON  Region Seqno    0x0000000000000005
     Replication State                      ON  Region Seqno    0x0000000000000004
     Replication State                     OFF  Region Seqno    0x0000000000000001
     Replication State                      ON  Region Seqno    0x0000000000000004
   ydbuser@melbourne:~/jnlex$

Since the largest Region Seqno is 0x6 (region DEFAULT in Paris), that is the preferred new originating primary instance. So, make Paris the new originating primary and Santiago the new secondary to which Paris replicates.

Now boot the Santiago virtual machine, simulating it coming up after repairs, and perform a MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK BACKWARD FETCHRESYNC. Note that the unreplicated transaction file :code:`Unreplic_Trans_Report_20220413164446.txt` has data in it, the update that had not been replicated to Paris when Santiago crashed.

.. note::

   YottaDB reports what the unreplicated updates were and resynchronizes the database; it is up to the application to reconcile the rolled-off unreplicated queries. YottaDB provides a `$zqgblmod() M function <../ProgrammersGuide/functions.html#zqgblmod-function>`_ that an application can use to help with the reconciliation. If your application uses :code:`$zqgblmod()`, review the MUPIP REPLICATE SOURCE NEEDRESTART and MUPIP REPLICATE SOURCE LOSTTNCOMPLETE described in `Switchover Possibilities in an A -> B replication configuration <../AdminOpsGuide/dbrepl.html#switchover-poss-a-b-repl>`_ to ensure that :code:`$zqgblmod()` reports accurate information.

Shut down whichever were the replicating secondary instances - Santiago and Melbourne in the example above – and use the originating primary instance (Paris) for the backup exercises.

------
Backup
------

Backup when an application is not running is straightforward – just copy the database files. Backup when an application is operating normally, without impacting the application (except of course for the additional IO load of the backup activity) is easy with YottaDB, and can be accomplished in two ways, one non-YottaDB and other YottaDB:

- The non-YottaDB way is to use a disk mirror (e.g., RAID or SAN). Issue a `MUPIP FREEZE <../AdminOpsGuide/dbmgmt.html#mupip-freeze>`_ to momentarily freeze updates and flush updates to disk. Then break the mirror and release the freeze. After backing up the mirror, rebuild it, and let it “catch up.” This is not discussed further here.

- The YottaDB way: a transaction-consistent backup of an entire multi-region database can be accomplished with a single YottaDB `MUPIP BACKUP <../AdminOpsGuide/dbmgmt.html#mupip-backup>`_ command. There are numerous options to satisfy virtually every type of backup need.

.. note::

   As a protection against operational mishaps, database files store their current journal file name in the database file header and journal file headers store their database file names. Copying database files when they are not open, or taking a snapshot with a MUPIP FREEZE will create database file copies that include journal file names. As this weakens the protection, consider a `MUPIP SET NOJOURNAL <../AdminOpsGuide/ydbjournal.html#set-action-qualifiers>`_ on copied database files to wipe journal file names from the file headers of copied database files. `MUPIP BACKUP BACKUPDBJNL=DISABLE <../AdminOpsGuide/dbmgmt.html#mupip-backup-bkupdbjnl>`_ also provides this option.

Exercise - Backup
+++++++++++++++++

This exercise demonstrates backups that preserve transaction-consistency in a multi-region database with a simulated application that performs transactions that span multiple database regions. The database created in the exercises so far has three regions, CRUSTACEANS, DEFAULT, and MAMMALS. Until externally terminated, each process in the simulated workload has an infinite loop that makes updates inside a transaction to all three regions as follows:

.. code-block:: none

   Loop for ever (until terminated by an external signal like Ctrl-C or a kill from the shell)
    Start transaction
      Get the time in microseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC
      Generate a random number
      Set ^Delta(time) to the random number
      Set ^Crab(time) to the value of ^Crab(lasttime) minus the random number, where lasttime is the previous subscript for ^Crab()
      Set ^Horse(time) to the value of ^Horse(lasttime) plus the random number, where lasttime is the previous subscript for ^Horse()
    Commit the transaction
    Hang for half a second

The database is initialized as follows:

.. code-block:: none

   Delete existing trees for ^Crab, ^Delta and ^Horse
   Initialize ^Crab(0) and ^Horse(0) to zero

Even when multiple concurrent simulated application processes are running and updating the database, regardless of the language in which each application process is written, ACID properties require:

- The series of :code:`time` (:code:`time>0`) subscripts for :code:`^Delta()`, :code:`^Crab()` and :code:`^Horse` to be the same.
- For the :code:`time` subscripts for which nodes exist:

  - The sum of :code:`Crab(time)` and :code:`Horse(time)` to be zero.
  - :code:`^Horse(time)` to equal the sum of all the entries for :code:`^Delta()` through :code:`^Delta(time)`.

ACID properties require the above to be satisfied for any transaction-consistent backup of the database.

Work with whichever instance was your last originating instance; if you followed the replication exercise above, this is the Paris instance. This is mostly a matter of convenience - as you know from the replication exercises, any instance can be switched to a primary role, and other instances can be swiched to secondary roles following a MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK BACKWARD FETCHRESYNC command with the primary instance.

Prepare for backups by creating a :code:`jnlex/backup` subdirectory where you can put your backups. In that directory, copy the :code:`jnlex_env` and :code:`ydb.gld` files from the :code:`jnlex` directory, naming the former to :code:`jnlex_bak_env`. Edit :code:`jnlex_bak_env` to  set the :code:`ydb_dir` environment variable to point to the :code:`backup` subdirectory. Note that since the file names in each segment of the global directory point to the corresponding files in the :code:`$ydb_dir` directory, changing the value of :code:`ydb_dir` suffices to have the global directory point to the database files in the subdirectory, and no change to the global directory is required.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ mkdir backup ; cd backup
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex/backup$ cp ../jnlex_env jnlex_bak_env
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex/backup$ cp ../ydb.gld ./
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex/backup$ nano jnlex_bak_env
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex/backup$ cat jnlex_bak_env
   export ydb_dist=$(pkg-config --variable=prefix yottadb)
   export ydb_routines=". $ydb_dist/libyottadbutil.so"
   alias yottadb=$ydb_dist/yottadb
   alias mupip=$ydb_dist/mupip
   export ydb_dir=$HOME/jnlex/backup
   export ydb_gbldir=$ydb_dir/ydb.gld
   export ydb_chset=utf-8
   export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
   export ydb_icu_version=$(pkg-config --modversion icu-io)
   export ydb_principal_editing=EDITING
   export ydb_repl_instance=$ydb_dir/paris.repl
   export ydb_repl_instname=paris
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex/backup$


Revert to the :code:`jnlex` directory. Remember to source the :code:`jnlex_env` file if you have not already.

.. note::
   If you shut down and restarted the Paris instance after the previous exercise, you will need to run a MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK BACKWARD if you did not shut it down cleanly. Even if you shut it down cleanly, that is a safe command to run. Then, you will need to start at least one Source Server.

   BACKUP COMPLETED.

   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$

After the backup is completed, you can terminate the application processes updating the database; they have done their part for the exercise.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ kill %1
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ %YDB-F-FORCEDHALT, Image HALTed by MUPIP STOP

   [1]   Exit 241                ./xyzTransC

   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ kill %4
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$

   [4]+  Exit 1                  node xyzTransNode.js
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ kill %5
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ %YDB-F-FORCEDHALT, Image HALTed by MUPIP STOP

   [5]   Exit 241                ./xyzTransPerl.pl
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ kill %5
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ %YDB-F-FORCEDHALT, Image HALTed by MUPIP STOP

   [6]-  Exit 241                python3 xyzTransPython.py
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ kill %6
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ %YDB-F-FORCEDHALT, Image HALTed by MUPIP STOP

   [7]+  Exit 1                  cargo run --quiet --example xyzTransRust  (wd: ~/jnlex/YDBRust)
   (wd now: ~/jnlex)
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$

Now change to the backup directory and :code:`source jnlex_bak_env` to set the environment variables. Notice that the MUPIP BACKUP operation has created three database files and a replication instance file. If you want to create a new instance, e.g., Beijing, you can use these backed up database and replication instance files.

Download a program to verify that ACID properties are preserved in the backed up database, your choice of programs in C (`xyzVerifyC.c <./xyzVerifyC.c>`_), Go (`xyzVerifyGo.go <./xyzVerifyGo.go>`_), M (`xyzVerifyM.m <./xyzVerifyM.m>`_), Node.js (`xyzVerifyNode.js <xyzVerifyNode.js>`_), Perl (`xyzVerifyPerl.pl <./xyzVerifyPerl.pl>`_), Python (`xyzverifyPython.py <xyzVerifyPython.py>`_) or Rust( `xyzVerifyRust.rs <https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/Lang/YDBRust/-/blob/master/examples/xyzVerifyRust.rs>`_). As with previous Rust programs, run :code:`xyzVerifyRust.rs` from the YDBRust directory.

Although all seven are shown here, as with initialization, you only need one.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex/backup$ gcc $(pkg-config --libs --cflags yottadb) -o xyzVerifyC xyzVerifyC.c -lyottadb
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex/backup$ ./xyzVerifyC

Exercise - Replication Briefly Revisited
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

During the backup exercise, the application has not been replicating to Melbourne and Santiago. This would have created quite a backlog, reported by the MUPIP REPLICATE SOURCE BACKLOG command.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ source jnlex_env
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ mupip replicate -source -showbacklog
   Thu Apr 14 19:19:12 2022 : Initiating SHOWBACKLOG operation on source server pid [919] for secondary instance [santiago]
   2900 : backlog number of transactions written to journal pool and yet to be sent by the source server
   2906 : sequence number of last transaction written to journal pool
   6 : sequence number of last transaction sent by source server
   Thu Apr 14 19:19:12 2022 : Initiating SHOWBACKLOG operation on source server pid [916] for secondary instance [melbourne]
   2900 : backlog number of transactions written to journal pool and yet to be sent by the source server
   2906 : sequence number of last transaction written to journal pool
   6 : sequence number of last transaction sent by source server
   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$


Boot Melbourne. If it was not shut down cleanly, perform a MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK BACKWARD FETCHRESYNC command to recover the database and resynchronize replication with Paris. As with MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK BACKWARD (without the RESYNC), this is a safe operation even if Melbourne was shut down cleanly.

Then execute the :code:`./replicating_start` script and notice that Melbourne catches up.

   ydbuser@melbourne:~/jnlex$

Notice that Paris now shows a zero backlog for Melbourne, but still has a large backlog for Santiago.

.. code-block:: bash

   ydbuser@paris:~/jnlex$ mupip replicate -source -showbacklog
   Thu Apr 14 19:27:30 2022 : Initiating SHOWBACKLOG operation on source server pid [919] for secondary instance [santiago]
   2900 : backlog number of transactions written to journal pool and yet to be sent by the source server
   2906 : sequence number of last transaction written to journal pool
   6 : sequence number of last transaction sent by source server
   Thu Apr 14 19:27:30 2022 : Initiating SHOWBACKLOG operation on source server pid [916] for secondary instance [melbourne]
   0 : backlog number of transactions written to journal pool and yet to be sent by the source server

If you like, you can similarly boot Santiago and show that it also clears the backlog automatically. Shut down the instances when you are done.
