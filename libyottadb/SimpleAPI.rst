========
Overview
========

This is user documentation for accessing the YottaDB engine from C
using the Simple API. A process can both call the Simple API as well as
call functions written in M and exported.

**Caveat:** This code does not exist yet. The user documentation is
being written ahead of the code, and will change in the event the code
needs to differ from this documentation.

================
Using libyottadb
================

1. Install YottaDB.
#. Include the ``yottadb.h`` file in your C program and compile it.
#. Perform any database configuration and initialization needed
   (configuring global directories, creating database files, starting a
   Source Server process, etc.).
#. Run your program, ensuring either that ``libyottadb.so`` is in the
   load path of your program, or that it is preloaded.

========
Concepts
========

Key-value

Local and global variables

Subscripts (keys) of variables accessed using Simple API are
strings. When a string is a `canonical number`_ YottaDB internally
converts and stores it as a number. When ordering (collating)
subscripts:

  - Null (empty string) subscripts precede all numeric
    subscripts.

    - **YottaDB strongly recommends against applications that use null subscripts.**

  - Numeric subscripts precede string subscripts.
    
    - Numeric subscripts in numeric order.

  - String subscripts collate in byte order.

==========
Data Types
==========

Data types are defined by including ``yottadb.h`` and are one of:

``ydb_int_t`` and ``ydb_uint_t`` -- Signed and unsigned integers,
that are *at least* 16 bits.

``ydb_long_t`` and ``ydb_ulong_t`` -- Signed and unsigned integers,
that are *at least* 32 bits.

``ydb_longlong_t`` and ``ydb_ulonglong_t`` - Signed and unsigned
integers that are *at least* 64 bits. See `Numeric Considerations`_
below.

``ydb_status_t`` -- A signed integer which is the return value
(status) of a call to a libyottadb function.

==================
Symbolic Constants
==================

The ``yottadb.h`` file defines several symbolic constants, which are
one of the following types:

- Function Return Codes, which in turn are one of:

  + Normal Return Codes
  + Error Return Codes

- Limits
- Other


Function Return Codes
=====================

Return codes from calls to libyottadb are of type
``ydb_status_t``. Normal return codes are non-negative (greater than
or equal to zero); error return codes are negative.

-------------------
Normal Return Codes
-------------------

Symbolic constants for normal return codes are prefixed with ``YDB_``.

``YDB_STATUS_OK`` -- Normal return following successful execution.

------------------
Error Return Codes
------------------

Symbolic constants for error codes returned by calls to libyottadb are
prefixed with ``YDB_ERR_``. [#]_ The symbolic constants below are not
intended to be a complete list of all error messages that Simple API
functions can return - the ``ydb_message()`` functions provides a way
to get detailed information about a error codes for those without
symbolic constants.

.. [#] Note for implementers: the actual values are negated ZMESSAGE
       error codes.

``YDB_ERR_GVINVALID`` -- A global variable name is too long. [#]_

.. [#] Note for implementers: YottaDB silently truncates local
       variable names that are too long. The implementation should
       catch this and return an error code, e.g., something like
       ``YDB_ERR_LVINVALID``.

``YDB_ERR_GVUNDEF`` -- No value exists at a requested global variable
node.

``YDB_ERR_LVUNDEF`` -- No value exists at a requested local variable
node. [#]_

.. [#] Note for implementers: under the covers, this is ``UNDEF`` but
       renamed to be more meaningful.

``YDB_ERR_INVSTRLEN`` -- A buffer provided by the caller is not long
enough for the string to be returned, or the length of a string passed
as a parameter exceeds ``YDB_MAX_STR``.

``YDB_ERR_KEY2BIG`` -- The length of a global variable name and
subscripts exceeds the limit configured for a database region.

``YDB_ERR_MAXNRSUBSCRIPTS`` -- The number of subscripts specified in
the call exceeded ``YDB_MAX_SUB``.

``YDB_ERR_UNKNOWN`` -- A call to ``ydb_zmessage()`` specified an
invalid message code.

Limits
======

Symbolic constants for limits are prefixed with ``YDB_MAX_``. Unless
otherwise noted, symbolic constants are unsigned integers guaranteed to
fit within the range of a ``ydb_uint_t`` type.

``YDB_MAX_IDENT`` --The maximum space in bytes required to store a
complete variable name, including the preceding caret for a global
variable.

``YDB_MAX_MSG`` -- The maximum length in bytes of any message string
associated with a message code. A buffer of length ``YDB_MAX_MSG``
bytes ensures that a call to ``ydb_zmessage()`` will not return a
``YDB_ERR_INVSTRLEN`` return code.

``YDB_MAX_STR`` -- The maximum length of a string (or blob) in bytes. A
caller to ``ydb_get()`` that provides a buffer of ``YDB_MAX_STR`` will
never get a ``YDB_ERR_INVSTRLEN`` error. ``YDB_MAX_STR`` is guaranteed
to fit in a ``ydb_ulong_t`` type.

``YDB_MAX_SUB`` -- The maximum number of subscripts for a local or
global variable.

===============
Data Structures
===============

``ydb_string_t`` is a descriptor for a string [#]_ value, and consists of
the following fields:

 - ``alloc`` and ``used`` -- fields of type ``ydb_strlen_t`` where
   ``alloc`` â‰¥ ``used``
 - ``address`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_zchar_t``, the starting address of
   a string

.. [#] Strings in YottaDB are arbitrary sequences of bytes that are not
       null-terminated. Other languages may refer to them as binary
       data or blobs.

======
Macros
======

``YDB_ALLOC_STRING(x, strlit)`` -- Allocate a ``ydb_string_t`` structure
and initialize it to ``strlit``, returning the address of the
structure. Note that while the ``used`` field is the size of
``strlit``, the ``alloc`` field may be rounded up to a larger
value. [#]_

.. [#] Note for implementers: under the covers, ``YDB_ALLOC_STRING()``
       and ``YDB_FREE_STRING()`` should call the ``ydb_malloc()`` and
       ``ydb_free()`` functions, which are aliases for the
       ``gtm_malloc()`` and ``gtm_free()`` functions (i.e., either
       prefix calls the same function).

``YDB_FREE_STRING(x)`` -- Free the ``ydb_string_t`` structure pointed
to by ``x``.
   
===
API
===

As YottaDB local and global variables can have variable numbers of
subscripts, to allow the libyottadb Simple API functions to have
variable numbers of parameters, the last parameter must always be NULL
(the standard C symbolic constant).

.. code-block:: c

	ydb_status_t ydb_data(
		ydb_uint_t *value,
		ydb_string_t *varname,
		[ ydb_string_t *subscript, ... ]
		NULL);

In the location pointed to by ``value``, returns the following information about
the local or global variable node identified by glvn:

- 0 -- There is neither a value nor a sub-tree, i.e., it is undefined.
- 1 -- There is a value, but no sub-tree
- 10 -- There is no value, but there is a sub-tree.
- 11 -- There are both a value and a subtree.

STUFF BELOW IS FROM OLD DOCUMENT
================================

Query
=====

``ydb_status_t ydb_alias_handle( ydb_string_t *value, ydb_varsub_t *lvn )``
  In the location pointed to by ``value->address`` returns the handle of the local
  variable referenced by lvsub. It is not meaningful for a caller to perform any
  operations on handles except to compare two handles for equality.

``ydb_status_t ydb_data( ydb_uint_t *value, ydb_varsub_t *glvn )``
  In the location pointed to by ``value``, returns the following information about
  the local or global variable node identified by glvn:

  - 0 -- There is neither a value nor a sub-tree, i.e., it is undefined.
  - 1 -- There is a value, but no sub-tree
  - 10 -- There is no value, but there is a sub-tree.
  - 11 -- There are both a value and a subtree.

  The following values are only meaningful if glvn identifies a local variable node:

  - 100 -- The node is an alias, but there is neither a value nor a sub-tree.
  - 101 -- The node is an alias with a value but sub-tree.
  - 110 -- The node is an alias with no value, but with a sub-tree.
  - 111 -- The node is an alias with a value and a sub-tree.

``ydb_get( ydb_value_t *value, ydb_varsub_t *glivn )``
  In the container pointer to by ``value``, libyottadb returns the value referred to
  by ``glivn``. If there is no value at the requested global or local variable node,
  or if the intrinsic special variable does not exist,a non-zero return value of
  YDB_ERR_GVUNDEF, YDB_ERR_INVSVN, or YDB_ERR_UNDEF indicates the error.

  In a database application, a global variable node can potentially be
  changed by another process between the time that a process calls
  ``ydb_length()`` to get the length of the data in a node and a
  ``ydb_get()`` call to get that data. If a caller cannot ensure from
  the application schema that the size of the buffer it provides is
  large enough for a string returned by ``ydb_get()``, it should code
  in anticipation of a potential ``YDB_ERR_INVSTRLEN`` return code
  from ``ydb_get()``.

``ydb_length(ydb_ulong_t *value1, ydb_ulong_t *value2, ydb_ulong_t *value3, ydb_varsub_t *glivn)``

  For each non-null ``value*`` parameter, in the memory location
  pointed to by that parameter, lobyottadb returns the following
  information about the node specified by ``*glivsub``. If there is no
  value at the requested global or local variable node, or if a
  requested intrinsic special variable does not exist,a non-zero
  return value of YDB_ERR_GVUNDEF, YDB_ERR_INVSVN, or YDB_ERR_UNDEF
  indicates the error.

  - ``*value1`` -- the length of the data in bytes. If the data is
    numeric, ``*value1`` has the length of the canonical string
    representation of that value.
  - ``*value2`` -- if the environment variable ``ydb_chset`` at
    process startup has the (case insensitive) value "UTF-8",
    ``*value2`` has the length of ``*glivsub`` in bytes; otherwise
    ``*value2`` is the same as ``*value1``.
  - ``*value3`` -- if the environment variable ``ydb_chset`` at
    process startup has the (case insensitive) value "UTF-8",
    ``*value3`` has the length of ``*glivsub`` in glyphs; otherwise
    ``*value3`` is the same as ``*value1``.

``ydb_node_next(ydb_varsub_t *next, ydb_value_t *value, ydb_varsub_t *glvn)``

  ``ydb_node_next()`` returns the next node in the tree in depth first
  search order, if one exists:

  - If ``next->varname->name->alloc`` â‰¥ ``glvn->varname->name->used``
    ``ydb_node_next()`` copies the ``name->address`` and
    ``name->used`` sub-fields from the
    ``glvn->varname`` stucture to the ``next->varname`` structure, returning a
    ``YDB_ERR_INVSTRLEN`` error if ``next->varname->name->alloc`` <
    ``glvn->varname->name->used``.

  - If ``next->varsub_alloc`` is large enough to hold the subscripts
    ``ydb_node_next()`` sets ``next->varsub_used`` to the actual
    number of subscripts, and

Programming Notes
=================

Dynamic typing with automatic conversion
========================================

The YottaDB engine internally automatically converts values between
numbers and strings as needed. Thus it is legitimate to lexically
compare the numbers 2 and 11, with the expected result that 11 precedes
2, and it is equally legitimate to numerically compare the strings "2"
and "11", with the expected result that 11 is greater than 2 -- the
functions for numeric and lexical comparisons are different.

In the ``ydb_value_t`` structure, a caller specifies what conversion,
if any, it wishes the called libyottadb function to perform on the
return value:

  - When a value is numeric, and the requested type is a string (the
    ``tag`` field is ``YDB_STRING_STAR``), libyottadb returns the
    number as a canonical string in the ``ydb_string_t`` structure
    pointed to by ``string_star``
  - When the value is a string, and the requested type is numeric,
    libyottadb converts

When returning a string,libyottadb functions *always* check that the
``alloc`` field of the ``ydb_string_t`` structure is large enough for
the result, returning a ``YDB_ERR_STRLEN`` error if it is not.

Numeric Considerations
======================

To ensure the accuracy of financial calculations, YottaDB internally
stores nnumbers as, and performs arithmetic using, a scaled packed
decimal representation with 18 signicant decimal digits, with
optimizations for values within a certain subset of its full
range. Consequently:

- Any number that is exactly represented in YottaDB can be exactly
  represented as a string, with reasonably efficient conversion back
  and forth.
- Any integer value of up to 18 significant digits can be exactly
  represented by an integer type such as ``ydb_longlong-t``, and
  integers in the inclusive range Â±999,999 are handled more efficiently
  than larger integers.
- In YottaDB there are numbers which can be exactly represented (such
  as 0.1), but whcih cannot be exactly represented in binary floating
  point.
- In 64 bit integers and binary floating point formats, there are
  numbers which can be exactly represented, but which cannot be exactly
  represented in YottaDB.

This means that for numeric keys which are not guaranteed to be
integers:

- In theory, there are edge cases where a value (which would internally
  be in YottaDB format) returned by a function such as
  ``ydb_subscript_next()`` and converted to a ``ydb_double_t`` when
  passed back to C application code, and then converted back to YottaDB
  internal format in a call to ``ydb_get()`` can result in the node not
  being found because the double conversion produces a number not
  identical to the original. Furthermore, there is a cost to the
  conversion.
- Passing keys back and forth as strings avoids those edge cases, but of
  course still has a conversion cost.

To preserve accuracy of numeric values that are returned by libyottadb,
and which an application code intends to simply pass back to libyottadb
as a libyottadb provides a ``ydb_numeric_t`` type. A value obtained
from libyottadb in ``ydb_numeric_t`` loses no precision when returned
to libyottadb, and as a further benefit is very efficient. While the
actual value of ``ydb_numeric_t`` is opaque to application cod, the
``ydb_convert()`` function is available.

Conversely, when passed a string that is a `canonical number`_ for use
as a key, libyottadb automatically converts it to a number. This
automatic internal conversion is irrelevant for the majority of typical
application that:

- simply store and retrieve data associated with keys, potentially
  testing for the existence of nodes; or
- transfer keys which are numeric values between application code and
  libyottadb using numeric types and expect numeric ordering.

However, this automatic internal conversion does affect applications
that:

- use numeric keys and expect the keys to be sorted in lexical order
  rather than numeric order; or
- transfer keys which are numeric values between application code and
  libyottadb as strings that may or may not be canonical numbers.

Applications that are affected by automatic internal conversion should
prefix their keys with a character such as "x" which ensures that keys
are not canonical numbers.

.. _canonical number:

-----------------
Canonical Numbers
-----------------

Conceptually, a canonical number is a string from the Latin character
set that represents a decimal number in a standard, concise, form.

#. Any string of decimal digits, optionally preceded by a minus sign
   ("-"), the first of which is not "0" (except for the number zero
   itself), that represents an integer of no more than 18 significant
   digits.

   - The following are canonical numbers: "-1", "0", "3", "10",
     "99999999999999999999", "999999999999999999990". Note that the
     last string has only 18 significant digits even though it is 19
     characters long.
   - The following are not canonical numbers: "+1" (starts with "+"),
     "00" (has an extra leading zero), "999999999999999999999" (19
     significant digits).

#. Any string of decimal digits, optionally preceded by a minus sign
   that includes one decimal point ("."), the first and last of which
   are not "0", that represents a number of no more than 18 significant
   digits.

   - The following are canonical numbers: "-.1", ".3",
     ".99999999999999999999".
   - The following are not canonical numbers "+.1" (starts with "+"),
     "0.3" (first digit is "0"), ".999999999999999999990" (last digit
     is "0"), ".999999999999999999999" (more than 18 significant
     digits).

#. Any of the above two forms followed by "E" followed by a canonical
   number integer in the range -43 to +47 such that the magnitude of
   the resulting number is between 1E-43 through.1E47.
  

Tokens
======

Since numeric and non-numeric subscripts can be freely intermixed in
YottaDB, it requires knowledge of the application schema to know
whether an application mixes numeric and string subscripts at the same
level for a variable.

*Consider whether this can be deferred for an initial implementation.*
