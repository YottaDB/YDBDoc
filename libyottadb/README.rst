Overview
========

This is the user documentation for directly accessing the YottaDB
engine without the need to go through a shim implemented in its
embedded scripting language, M. A process can both call the engine
directly as well as call functions written in M and exported.

**Caveat:** This code does not exist yet. The user documentation is
being written ahead of the code, and will change in the event the code
needs to differ from this documentation.

================
Using libyottadb
================

1. Install YottaDB.
#. Include the ``yottadb.h`` file in your C program and compile it.
#. Perform any database configuration and initialization needed
   (configuring global directories, creating database files, starting a
   Source Server process, etc.).
#. Run your program, ensuring either that ``libyottadb.so`` is in the
   load path of your program, or that it is preloaded.

Data Types
==========

Data types are defined by including ``yottadb.h`` and are one of:

- User Defined Types, which in turn are one of:

  - Integer
  - Floating Point
  - Other

- Enumerated Types

User Defined Types
==================

----
Byte
----

``ydb_zchar_t`` -- An unsigned data value that is *exactly* 8-bits (one
byte).

-------
Integer
-------

``ydb_int_t`` and ``ydb_uint_t`` -- Signed and unsigned integers,
that are *at least* 16 bits.

``ydb_long_t`` and ``ydb_ulong_t`` -- Signed and unsigned integers,
that are *at least* 32 bits.

``ydb_longlong_t`` and ``ydb_ulonglong_t`` - Signed and unsigned
integers that are *at least* 64 bits. See `Numeric Considerations`_
below.

--------------
Floating Point
--------------

``ydb_float_t`` -- A floating point number that is *at least* 32 bits
in the representation of the underlying computing platform. See
`Numeric Considerations`_ below.

``ydb_double_t`` -- A floating point number that is *at least* 64 bits
in the representation of the underlying computing platform. See
`Numeric Considerations`_ below.

-------------
Other Scalars
-------------

``ydb_numeric_t`` -- A numeric quantity in YottaDB's internal
representation used to get values known to be numeric from YottaDB in
order to pass them back to other functions without processing by the
caller. Except when a caller needs to manipulate a numeric value
returned by YottaDB, passing parameters as ``ydb_numeric_t`` types is
the most efficient way to pass numeric quantities between YottaDB
and C.

``ydb_status_t`` -- Return value (status) of a call to a libyottadb
function.

``ydb_token_t`` -- The type of a token that represents a value stored
within YottaDB. Functions such as ``ydb_get()`` or
``ydb_subscript_*()`` used to get values -- either numeric or strings
-- to be passed to other functions without processing by the caller can
be directed to return token values of type
``ydb_token_t``. Depending on the circumstances, using tokens may
save CPU cycles on type conversion. See `Tokens`_ below.
*Consider whether to omit tokens on initial implementation.*

``ydb_tpfnptr_t`` -- A pointer to a function with a single ``void *``
parameter passed by value, and a single ``ydb_status__t`` parameter
passed by reference. see `Transaction Processing`_ below.

Ennumerated Types
=================

``ydb_type_t`` -- Defines the type of value in a ``ydb_value_t``
structure. Values of a ``ydb_type_t`` are:

- ``YDB_CONSTSTRING_STAR`` -- pointer to a literal string constant
- ``YDB_DOUBLE_STAR`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_double_t`` value
- ``YDB_DOUBLE_VAL`` -- value of type ``ydb_double_t``
- ``YDB_EMPTY`` -- the ``ydb_value_t`` structure does not contain a
  value
- ``YDB_FLOAT_STAR`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_float_t`` value
- ``YDB_FLOAT_VAL`` -- value of type ``ydb_float_t``
- ``YDB_INT_STAR`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_int_t`` value
- ``YDB_INT_VAL`` -- value of type ``ydb_int_t``
- ``YDB_LONG_STAR`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_long_t`` value
- ``YDB_LONG_VAL`` -- value of type ``ydb_long_t``
- ``YDB_LONGLONG_STAR`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_longlong_t`` type
- ``YDB_LONGLONG_VAL`` -- value of type ``ydb_long_t``
- ``YDB_NUMERIC_STAR`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_numeric_t`` type
- ``YDB_NUMERIC_VAL`` -- value of type ``ydb_numeric_t``
- ``YDB_STRING_STAR`` -- pointer to a structure of type ``ydb_string_t``
- ``YDB_TOKEN_VAL`` -- value of type ``ydb_token_t``
- ``YDB_UINT_STAR`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_uint_t`` type
- ``YDB_UINT_VAL`` -- value of type ``ydb_uint_t``
- ``YDB_ULONG_STAR`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_ulong_t`` value
- ``YDB_ULONG_VAL`` -- value of type ``ydb_ulong_t``
- ``YDB_ZCHAR_STAR`` - pointer to a ``ydb_zchar_t`` value
- ``YDB_ZCHAR_VAL`` -- value of type ``ydb_zchar_t``

==================
Symbolic Constants
==================

The ``yottadb.h`` file defines several symbolic constants, which are
one of the following types:

- Function Return Codes, which in turn are one of:

  + Normal Return Codes
  + Error Return Codes

- Limits
- Other


Function Return Codes
=====================

Return codes from calls to libyottadb are of type ``ydb_status_t``.

-------------------
Normal Return Codes
-------------------

Symbolic constants for normal return codes are prefixed with ``YDB_``.

``YDB_STATUS_OK`` -- Normal return following successful execution.

``YDB_VALUE_EQU`` -- A call to a ``ydb_*_compare()`` function reports
that the arguments are equal.

``YDB_VALUE_GT`` -- A call to a ``ydb_*_compare()`` function reports
that the first argument is greater than the second (for numeric
comparisons) or lexically follows the second (for string comparisons).

``YDB_VALUE_LT`` -- A call to a ``ydb_*_compare()`` function reports
that the first argument is less than the second (for numeric
comparisons) or lexically precedes the second (for string comparisons).


------------------
Error Return Codes
------------------

Symbolic constants for error codes returned by calls to libyottadb are
prefixed with ``YDB_ERR_``.

``YDB_ERR_GVUNDEF`` -- No value exists at a requested global variable
node.

``YDB_ERR_INVMSGNNUM`` -- A call to ``ydb_zmessage()`` specified an
invalid message code.

``YDB_ERR_INVSTRLEN`` -- A buffer provided by the caller is not long
enough for the string to be returned.

``YDB_ERR_INVSUBS`` -- The number of entries in a ``ydb_varsub_t``
structure provided by the caller is insufficient for the actual number
of subscripts to be returned.

``YDB_ERR_INVSVN`` -- A call referenced a non-existent intrinsic
special variable.

``YDB_ERR_INVTOKEN`` -- Either a call parameter specifies that the
value is a token, but the token is invalid, or libyottadb expects a
token, but the tag field is not ``YDB_INTERNAL``.

``YDB_ERR_LVUNDEF`` -- No value exists at a requested local variable
node.

Limits
======

Symbolic constants for limits are prefixed with ``YDB_MAX_``. Unless
otherwise noted, symbolic constants are unsigned integers guaranteed to
fit within the range of a ``ydb_uint_t`` type.

``YDB_MAX_IDENT`` --The maximum space in bytes required to store a
complete variable name, including the preceding caret for a global
variable.

``YDB_MAX_MSG`` -- The maximum length in bytes of any message string
associated with a message code. A buffer of length ``YDB_MAX_MSG``
bytes ensures that a call to ``ydb_zmessage()`` will not return a
``YDB_ERR_INVSTRLEN`` return code.

``YDB_MAX_STR`` -- The maximum length of a string (or blob) in bytes. A
caller to ``ydb_get()`` that provides a buffer of ``YDB_MAX_STR`` will
never get a ``YDB_ERR_INVSTRLEN`` error. ``YDB_MAX_STR`` is guaranteed
to fit in a ``ydb_ulong_t`` type.

``YDB_MAX_SUB`` -- The maximum number of subscripts (keys) for a local
or global variable. An array of ``YDB_MAX_SUB`` elements always
suffices to pass subscripts.

``YDB_MAX_VAR`` -- The maximum space in bytes required to store a
complete subscripted variable [#]_ (including caret and subscripts, but not
including any preceding global directory name for a global variable
reference).

.. [#] In M source code, as might be appropriate for an indirect
       reference.

Other
=====

``YDB_UNTIMED`` is a negative integer of type ``ydb_long_t`` to be
provided by a caller as the timeout parameter for the functions
``ydb_lock()`` and ``ydb_lock_incr()``.

===============
Data Structures
===============

``ydb_string_t`` is a descriptor for a string [#]_ value, and consists of
the following fields:

 - ``alloc`` and ``used`` -- fields of type ``ydb_strlen_t`` where
   ``alloc`` â‰¥ ``used``
 - ``address`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_zchar_t``, the starting address of
   a string

.. [#] Strings in YottaDB are arbitrary sequences of bytes that are not
       null-terminated. Other languages may refer to them as binary
       data or blobs.

``ydb_value_t`` -- used to transfer data between libyottadb and
callers. As libyottadb freely accepts both numbers and strings,
automatically convering as needed (see `Canonical Numbers`_ below),
whereas C is statically typed, the ``ydb_value_t`` is a structure that
contains a tag describing the data, and a container for the data which
is a union of the supported types. ``ydb_value_t`` consists of:

- ``tag`` -- a field of type ``ydb_type_t``

- a union of fields with the following names:

  - ``double_star`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_double_t`` value
  - ``double_val`` -- value of type ``ydb_double_t``
  - ``float_star`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_float_t`` value
  - ``float_val`` -- value of type ``ydb_float_t``
  - ``int_star`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_int_t`` value
  - ``int_val`` -- value of type ``ydb_int_t``
  - ``long_star`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_long_t`` value
  - ``long_val`` -- value of type ``ydb_long_t``
  - ``longlong_star`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_longlong_t`` type
  - ``longlong_val`` -- value of type ``ydb_long_t``
  - ``numeric_star`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_numeric_t`` type
  - ``numeric_val`` -- value of type ``ydb_numeric_t``
  - ``string_star`` -- pointer to a structure of type ``ydb_string_t``
  - ``uint_star`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_uint_t`` type
  - ``uint_val`` -- value of type ``ydb_uint_t``
  - ``ulong_star`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_ulong_t`` value
  - ``ulong_val`` -- value of type ``ydb_ulong_t``
  - ``zchar_star`` -- pointer to a ``ydb_zchar_t`` value
  - ``zchar_val`` -- value of type ``ydb_zchar_t``

``ydb_var_t`` -- used to specify names (i.e., without subscripts). It
consists of two fields:

- ``name`` -- a pointer to a ``ydb_string_t`` structure whose ``alloc``
  â‰¥ ``YDB_MAX_IDENT``
- ``accel`` -- a field that is opaque to the caller, but which
  libyottadb may use to optimize variable name processing. When a
  caller initializes a ``ydb_var_t`` structure, or changes the
  ``varname`` field to point to a different variable name, the caller
  **must** directly or indirectly invoke the ``YDB_RESET_ACCEL()``
  macro. A caller **must not** modify or otherwise use the ``accel``
  field except to reset it.

``ydb_varsub_t`` -- used to transfer complete variable names between
caller and libyottadb, and consists of the four fields:

- ``varname`` -- a ``ydb_var_t`` structure
- ``varsub_alloc`` and ``varsub_used`` --``ydb_uint_t`` values with a
  range of 0 through ``YDB_MAX_SUB`` that specify the number of
  subscripts for which space has been allocated and used in the
  ``varsubs`` array
- ``varsubs`` -- an array of ``ydb_value_t`` structures, each providing
  the value of a subscript

We recommend that applications use the ``YDB_VARSUB_ALLOC(num_subs)``
and ``YDB_VARSUB_RELEASE()`` macros to allocate ``ydb_varsub_t``
structures.

======
Macros
======

``YDB_RESET_ACCEL(x)`` -- Reset (initializes) the ``accel`` field of a
``ydb_var_t`` structure.

``YDB_SET_STRING(x, strlit)`` -- Allocate a ``ydb_string_t`` structure
and initialize it to ``strlit``. Note that while the ``used`` field is
the size of ``strlit``, the ``alloc`` field may be rounded up to a
larger value.

``YDB_SET_VARNAME_LIT(x, strlit)`` and ``YDB_SET_VARNAME(x, varname)``
-- Where x is a pointer to a ``ydb_var_t`` structure initialize that
structure, with a literal string in the first case, and where
``varname`` is a pointer to a ``ydb_string_t`` structure, to the string
in that structure. They also reset the ``accel`` field, removing the
need to call ``YDB_RESET_ACCEL()``.

``YDB_VARSUB_ALLOC(num_subs)`` -- Allocate a ``ydb_varsubs_t``
structure with space for ``num_subs`` subscripts, and initialize the
``varsub_alloc`` field to ``num_subs`` and the ``varsub_used`` field to
zero.

``YDB_VARSUB_FREE(x)`` -- Free (release back to unused memory) the
``ydb_varsub_t`` structure pointed to by x.

===
API
===

API functions are classified as one of:

- Query -- Functions that do not update any intrinsic, local or global
  variables. [#]_
- Update -- Functions that update intrinsic, local or global variables.
- Transaction Processing -- Functions that implement support for ACID
  transactions.

.. [#] Any call to libyottadb is permitted to update the ``accel``
       field of a ``ydb_var_t`` structure passed in to it.

       

Query
=====

``ydb_status_t ydb_alias_handle( ydb_string_t *value, ydb_varsub_t *lvn )``
  In the location pointed to by ``value->address`` returns the handle of the local
  variable referenced by lvsub. It is not meaningful for a caller to perform any
  operations on handles except to compare two handles for equality.

``ydb_status_t ydb_data( ydb_uint_t *value, ydb_varsub_t *glvn )``
  In the location pointed to by ``value``, returns the following information about
  the local or global variable node identified by glvn:

  - 0 -- There is neither a value nor a sub-tree, i.e., it is undefined.
  - 1 -- There is a value, but no sub-tree
  - 10 -- There is no value, but there is a sub-tree.
  - 11 -- There are both a value and a subtree.

  The following values are only meaningful if glvn identifies a local variable node:

  - 100 - The node is an alias, but there is neither a value nor a sub-tree.
  - 101 - The node is an alias with a value but sub-tree.
  - 110 - The node is an alias with no value, but with a sub-tree.
  - 111 - The node is an alias with a value and a sub-tree.

Programming Notes
=================

Numeric Considerations
======================

The YottaDB engine internally automatically converts values between
numbers and strings as needed. Thus it is legitimate to lexically
compare the numbers 2 and 11, with the expected result that 11 precedes
2, and it is equally legitimate to numerically compare the strings "2"
and "11", with the expected result that 11 is greater than 2. The
functions for numeric and lexical comparisons are different. A
subscript (key) of a variable can include numbers as well as
non-numeric strings, with all numeric subscripts preceding all
non-numeric strings when stepping through the subscripts in order.

To ensure the accuracy of financial calculations, YottaDB internally
stores nnumbers as, and performs arithmetic using, a scaled packed
decimal representation with 18 signicant decimal digits, with
optimizations for values within a certain subset of its full
range. Consequently:

- Any number that is exactly represented in YottaDB can be exactly
  represented as a string, with reasonably efficient conversion back
  and forth.
- Any integer value of up to 18 significant digits can be exactly
  represented by an integer type such as ``ydb_longlong-t``, and
  integers in the inclusive range Â±999,999 are handled more efficiently
  than larger integers.
- In YottaDB there are numbers which can be exactly represented (such
  as 0.1), but whcih cannot be exactly represented in binary floating
  point.
- In 64 bit integers and binary floating point formats, there are
  numbers which can be exactly represented, but which cannot be exactly
  represented in YottaDB.

This means that for numeric keys which are not guaranteed to be
integers:

- In theory, there are edge cases where a value (which would internally
  be in YottaDB format) returned by a function such as
  ``ydb_subscript_next()`` and converted to a ``ydb_double_t`` when
  passed back to C application code, and then converted back to YottaDB
  internal format in a call to ``ydb_get()`` can result in the node not
  being found because the double conversion produces a number not
  identical to the original. Furthermore, there is a cost to the
  conversion.
- Passing keys back and forth as strings avoids those edge cases, but of
  course still has a conversion cost.

To preserve accuracy of numeric values that are returned by libyottadb,
and which an application code intends to simply pass back to libyottadb
as a libyottadb provides a ``ydb_numeric_t`` type. A value obtained
from libyottadb in ``ydb_numeric_t`` loses no precision when returned
to libyottadb, and as a further benefit is very efficient. While the
actual value of ``ydb_numeric_t`` is opaque to application cod, the
``ydb_convert()`` function is available.

Conversely, when passed a string that is a `canonical number`_ for use
as a key, libyottadb automatically converts it to a number. This
automatic internal conversion is irrelevant for the majority of typical
application that:

- simply store and retrieve data associated with keys, potentially
  testing for the existence of nodes; or
- transfer keys which are numeric values between application code and
  libyottadb using numeric types and expect numeric ordering.

However, this automatic internal conversion does affect applications
that:

- use numeric keys and expect the keys to be sorted in lexical order
  rather than numeric order; or
- transfer keys which are numeric values between application code and
  libyottadb as strings that may or may not be canonical numbers.

Applications that are affected by automatic internal conversion should
prefix their keys with a character such as "x" which ensures that keys
are not canonical numbers.

.. _canonical number:

-----------------
Canonical Numbers
-----------------

Conceptually, a canonical number is a string that represents a decimal
number in a standard, concise, form.

#. Any string of decimal digits, optionally preceded by a minus sign
   ("-"), the first of which is not "0" (except for the number zero
   itself), that represents an integer of no more than 18 significant
   digits.

   - The following are canonical numbers: "-1", "0", "3", "10",
     "99999999999999999999", "999999999999999999990". Note that the
     last string has only 18 significant digits even though it is 19
     characters long.
   - The following are not canonical numbers: "+1" (starts with "+"),
     "00" (has an extra leading zero), "999999999999999999999" (19
     significant digits).

#. Any string of decimal digits, optionally preceded by a minus sign
   that includes one decimal point ("."), the first and last of which
   are not "0", that represents a number of no more than 18 significant
   digits.

   - The following are canonical numbers: "-.1", ".3",
     ".99999999999999999999".
   - The following are not canonical numbers "+.1" (starts with "+"),
     "0.3" (first digit is "0"), ".999999999999999999990" (last digit
     is "0"), ".999999999999999999999" (more than 18 significant
     digits).

#. Any of the above two forms followed by "E" followed by a canonical
   number integer in the range -43 to +47 such that the magnitude of
   the resulting number is between 1E-43 through.1E47.
  

Tokens
======

Since numeric and non-numeric subscripts can be freely intermixed in
YottaDB, it requires knowledge of the application schema to know
whether an application mixes numeric and string subscripts at the same
level for a variable.

*Consider whether this can be deferred for an initial implementation.*
