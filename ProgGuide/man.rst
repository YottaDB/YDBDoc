The Programmer's Guide describes how to develop and maintain applications using YottaDB/GT.M. For information on how to install the software and maintain the user environment, refer to the Administration and Operations Guide.

--------------------------
Intended Audience
--------------------------

This manual is intended for programmers who develop and/or maintain M applications in the YottaDB/GT.M environment. This manual assumes that the programmers have no previous knowledge of YottaDB/GT.M. However, it does assume that the programmers have access to the UNIX documentation that supplements the limited UNIX information in this manual.
