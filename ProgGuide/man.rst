The M Programmer's Guide describes how to develop and maintain applications using YottaDB. For information on how to install the software and maintain the user environment, refer to the `Administration and Operations Guide <../AdminOpsGuide/index.html>`_.

--------------------------
Intended Audience
--------------------------

This manual is intended for programmers who develop and/or maintain M applications in the YottaDB environment. This manual assumes that the programmers have no previous knowledge of YottaDB. However, it does assume that the programmers have access to the UNIX documentation that supplements the limited UNIX information in this manual.

-------------------------
Purpose of the Manual
-------------------------

The M Programmer's Guide documents all aspects of programming with M in the YottaDB environment.

--------------------------
How to use this Manual
--------------------------
