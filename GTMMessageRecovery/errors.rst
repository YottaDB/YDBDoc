ABNCOMPTINC
-----------

ABNCOMPTINC, Deviceparameter xxxx and deviceparameter yyyy are not compatible in the zzzz command

Compile Time Error: The command specifies incompatible deviceparameters (e.g., specifying both FIXED and VARIABLE).

Action: Refer to `Chapter 9 Input Output Processing in the Programmer's Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/ProgrammersGuide/ioproc.html>`_ and modify the list.

----------
ACOMPTBINC
----------

ACOMPTBINC, Deviceparameter xxxx is compatible with only yyyy in the command zzzz

Run Time Error: An OPEN, USE, or CLOSE command specifies a deviceparameter that does not apply to the command.

Action: Look for deviceparameters that should be on other I/O commands. For example, the deviceparameter DELETE is valid on CLOSE but produces this error if it is applied to the USE command.

--------------
ACTCOLLMISMTCH
--------------

ACTCOLLMISMTCH, Global ^gggg inherits alternative collation sequence #nnnn from global directory but database file dddd contains different collation sequence #mmmm for this global

Run Time Error: This indicates that the global gggg inherits collation nnnn from the global directory (globals that span multiple regions inherit collation 0 by default) but the directory tree in database file dddd contains a different collation sequence mmmm for this global.

Action: If nnnn is the right collation sequence to use, fix the database file dddd by using a temporary global directory that maps all names to dddd, extract the global, KILL it, use $$set^%GBLDEF to fix the alternative collation for gggg from mmmm to nnnn, reload the global from the extract, switch back to the regular global directory. If mmmm is the right collation sequence to use, recreate the global directory and define GBLNAME gggg to have that collation instead.

------------
ACTIVATEFAIL
------------

ACTIVATEFAIL, Cannot activate passive source server on instance iiii while a receiver server and/or update process is running

MUPIP Error: MUPIP REPLIC -SOURCE -ACTIVATE -ROOTPRIMARY (or -UPDOK) issues this error when the command attempts to activate a passive source server (and switch the instance from being a replicating secondary instance to an originating primary) while a receiver server and/or update process is already running

Action: Shutdown the receiver and/or update process and reissue the MUPIP REPLIC -SOURCE -ACTIVATE -ROOTPRIMARY (or -UPDOK) command. Note that any other YottaDB or MUPIP process that was running before the activation does not need to be shut down for the activation to succeed.

---------
ACTLSTEXP
---------

ACTLSTEXP, Actuallist expected

Run Time Error: This indicates that the DO command, without an actuallist of parameters, failed because its entryref argument specified a label that has a formallist of parameters.

Action: Review the interface between the DO and the subroutine. Add the actuallist to the DO, remove the formallist from the label, or identify another subroutine to invoke, as appropriate.


--------------
ACTLSTTOOLONG 
--------------

ACTLSTTOOLONG, More actual parameters than formal parameters: xxxx

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that the label xxxx with a formallist; is invoked from within a routine with a longer actuallist (during compile-time). At run-time, a similar error can occur when a longer actuallist is supplied by an invocation from another routine.

Action: Review the interface between the DO command and the subroutine. Modify the actuallist, formallist, and/or label, as appropriate.

----------
ACTOFFSET
----------

ACTOFFSET, Actuallist not allowed with offset

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a DO command or extrinsic specified an actuallist and an entryref that includes an offset.

Action: Look for an inappropriate offset.

---------
ACTRANGE
---------

ACTRANGE, Alternate Collating Type xxxx is out of range

Run Time Error: The alternate collation sequence type does not fall in the expected range of 0 to 255.

Action: Define a new collation sequence type that has a value between 0 and 255 inclusive. For more information, refer the `"Internationalization" chapter of the Programmer's Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/ProgrammersGuide/internatn.html>`_.

------------

-----------

AIMGBLKFAIL, AIMGBLKFAIL, After image build for block bbbb in region rrrr failed in DSE or MUPIP

GT.CM/DSE/MUPIP Error: MUPIP/DSE/GT.CM Error: DSE creates after images of blocks as a result of its physical manipulation of blocks and in MUPIP processes them in the course of RECOVER or ROLLBACK. This error indicates that such a manipulation failed on the block and region indicated.

Action: If you get this error from DSE, you may be working with a block with a damaged state that your DSE action does not sufficiently address - analyze the situation and consider other approaches. If you get this error from MUPIP, it may mean your journal or replication has damage, in which case you should investigate the state of block bbbb.

-----------
AIOBUFSTUCK
-----------

AIOBUFSTUCK, AIOBUFSTUCK, Waited mmmm minutes for PID: pppp to finish AIO disk write of block: bbbb

All YottaDB Components Warning: PID pppp did not receive a response from the I/O system after waiting for mmmm minutes. Block bbbb cannot accept further updates until the I/O completes.

Action: Examine the I/O subsystem characteristics for tuning or hardware problems, or competing activities.

Run Time Error: An internal YottaDB consistency check failed. This error occurs only in some special versions of YottaDB software.

Action: Report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel.


-----------
ASYNCIONOMM
-----------

ASYNCIONOMM, Database file ffffssss cannot cccc

MUPIP Error: This indicates that database file has current state ssss (" has ASYNCIO enabled;" or: " has MM access method;") and therefore cannot change to assume change cccc ("enable MM" or "enable ASYNCIO"). MUPIP SET can also issue the same message with the text: "; cannot enable MM and ASYNCIO at the same time".

Action: Address the blocking state - ASYNIO by disabling it, or MM access method by change it to BG before repeating the MUPIP command that produced this error.


-----------
ASYNCIONOV4
-----------

ASYNCIONOV4, rrrr database has ssss; cannot cccc

MUPIP Error: This indicates that region rrrr has current state ssss (ASYNCIO enabled) and therefore cannot change to assume change cccc (enable ASYNCIO).

Action: Address the blocking state - ASYNCIO by disabling it,  by completing an upgrade before repeating the MUPIP command that produced this error.


-------------
AUTODBCREFAIL
-------------

AUTODBCREFAIL, Automatic creation of database file DDDD associated with region RRRR failed; see associated messages for details

All YottaDB Components Error: Error occurs during the runtime creation of a database with the AUTODB flag set so it is automatcially created on open. This includes automatically defined statistics databases. The message is followed with the reason for the failure.

Action: Fix the reason for the failure and retry.

----------
BACKUPCTRL
----------

BACKUPCTRL, Control Y or control C encountered during backup, aborting backup

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that BACKUP terminated because of an operator <CTRL>-C or <CTRL>-Y.

Action: Do not rely on the result of this BACKUP. If appropriate, investigate whether any of the BACKUP output files are complete and therefore potentially useable.

------------
BACKUPKILLIP 
------------

BACKUPKILLIP, Kill in progress indicator is set for file ffff, backup database could have incorrectly marked busy integrity errors

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that one or more active process are performing KILL cleanup in database file ffff. Generally, BACKUP can wait for this to finish in order to get a consistent copy of the database. However, this indicates it waited several minute and is proceeding The resulting backup almost surely contains blocks incorrectly marked busy.

Action: Wait and perform the BACKUP when there are no large KILL operations triggering extensive cleanup. If this is not desirable, fix the errors in the backup copy (reported by an INTEG NOMAP) with DSE MAP FREE. If there are many such blocks you can edit the INTEG output to create a script to drive the DSE operations. Alternatively, if you can get standalone access, to the database you may use DSE MAP RESTORE. Do not use MAP RESTORE on an active database.

----------
BADACCMTHD
----------

BADACCMTHD, Invalid access method was specified, file not created

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that CREATE encountered an invalid access method for the dynamic segment in the current Global Directory, which is defined by the logical name GTM$GBLDIR / environment variable gtmgbldir.

Action: Use the Global Directory Editor (GDE) to verify the access method for the Global Directory. Look for the use of YottaDB components with different version numbers.


-----------

Action: Choose a valid case designation code.


-------
BADCHAR
-------

BADCHAR, XXX is not a valid character in the YYY encoding form.

Run Time Error: YottaDB triggers this error when it encounters a byte sequence that is not legal according to the given character set of the current device.

Action: Correct your application or its configuration to handle this situation. Depending on application requirements, the code may need handle the illegal byte sequence or disable the triggering of BADCHAR error by VIEW "NOBADCHAR" command. If the error is from a READ or WRITE command to a device other than $PRINCIPAL, the application can perform I/O in M-mode and then handle any needed conversion, correction, or other manipulation. For more information, refer to the `Programmer's Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/ProgrammersGuide/index.html>`_.

--------
BADCHSET
--------

BADCHSET, xxxx is not a valid character mapping in this context.

Run Time Error: When YottaDB recognizes that the expr in ICHSET=expr or OCHSET=expr is not one of the supported character set names ("M", "UTF-8", "UTF-16", "UTF-16LE" or "UTF-16BE"), it reports this error. Note that not all modes are supported under all conditions.

Action: Choose the proper designation for a supported character set.

Run Time Error: YottaDB detected a LOCK (or ZALLOCATE) argument using an extrinsic function that performed other LOCK (or ZALLOCATE) operations, which it could not safely nest.

Action: Revise the code to avoid such a construct. Note that YottaDB recommends avoiding this code pattern as it can produce unintended results that YottaDB does not detect.

-------
BADQUAL
-------

BADQUAL, Unrecognized qualifier: xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that a SET of $ZROUTINES specified xxxx, which is an unknown qualifier.

Action: Use an accepted qualifier: SRC= or NOSRC.


---------
BADREGION
---------

-----------
BKUPRUNNING
-----------

BKUPRUNNING, Process dddd is currently backing up region xxxx. Cannot start another backup.

MUPIP Error: MUPIP BACKUP -ONLINE only supports one backup at a time and this error indicates an attempt to start one before a previously started backup finished.

Action: Cancel the running BACKUP or reschedule this BACKUP to a time after the running BACKUP completes.

--------------
BKUPTMPFILOPEN
--------------

BKUPTMPFILOPEN, Open of backup temporary file aaaa failed

Run Time Error: When an online backup is in progress, a YottaDB process doing updates to the database is saving away the pre-update images of the blocks it updates in a special backup area used to make sure the backups are consistent. Periodically, these blocks need to be flushed out to a temporary file and are flushed by the process needing the space to put its own changed blocks. This means every running process needs to have R/W access to the temporary file created by the backup. If the process cannot open the temporary file, this error is written to the operator log, the backup is flagged as having encountered an error and the process proceeds. So this error is only backup related. It is NOT an error in the process itself which proceeds as if backup were not running.

Action: Determine cause of why process could not open temporary file, fix, and restart backup.

---------------
BKUPTMPFILWRITE
---------------

BKUPTMPFILWRITE, Write to backup temporary file aaaa failed

Run Time Error: When an online backup is in progress, a YottaDB process doing updates to the database is saving away the pre-update images of the blocks it updates in a special backup area used to make sure the backups are consistent. Periodically, these blocks need to be flushed out to a temporary file and are flushed by the process needing the space to put its own changed blocks. This means every running process needs to have R/W access to the temporary file created by the backup. If the database write generates an error, the BKUPTFWFAIL error is written to the operator log, the backup is flagged as having encountered an error and the process proceeds. So this error is only backup related. It is NOT an error in the process itself which proceeds as if backup were not running.

Action: Determine cause of why the write failed, fix, and restart backup.


------
BLKCNT
------

BLKCNT, Last LOAD Block/RMS Record number: xxxx

MUPIP Information: This indicates that a LOAD command with the FORMAT=BINARY qualifier completed at record number xxxx. Indicates the last block or record number successfully processed by MUPIP LOAD. This information may be useful for auditing the LOAD, or if a restart is required after a LOAD is stopped prematurely.

Action: -


--------------

DSE Error: DSE Error: The block (bbbb) you selected is not currently a valid block in the database file (ffff) for the region in which you are working.

Action: Action: Select a block less than nnnn or move to a different region

---------
BLKSIZ512
---------

BLKSIZ512, Block size xxxx rounds to yyyy

GDE/DSE Information: This indicates that an ADD, CHANGE, or TEMPLATE command defined the BLOCKSIZE qualifier equal to xxxx, which is not divisible by 512. GDE adjusted the block size to yyyy, which is the next largest multiple of 512.

Action: If yyyy is not acceptable, modify the BLOCKSIZE qualifier value so that it is divisible by 512.

-----------
BLKTOODEEP 
-----------

BLKTOODEEP, Block level too deep

Compile Time Error: This indicates that the line starts with too many level-indicator delimiters (.) for the level of nesting associated with the argumentless DO on the previous line.

Action: Remove inappropriate level indicator(s).

------------
BLKWRITERR
------------

BLKWRITERR, Unable to queue disk write for block XXXX. Will keep trying.

Run Time Information: This indicates that the disk is offline or not working because of a hardware or software problem in the disk subsystem.

Action: Check the disk subsystem operation.

-------------
BOMMISMATCH 
-------------

BOMMISMATCH, XXX Byte Order Marker found when YYY character set specified.

Run Time Error: A Byte Order Marker (BOM) for character set XXX was found at the beginning of a file specified as containing data in character set YYY.

Action: Specify the proper character set when opening the file.  For UTF-16 data, specifying CHSET="UTF-16" will use the BOM to determine whether the data is Little Endian or Big Endian.  If no BOM is found, YottaDB assumes Big Endian.

--------------
BOOLSIDEFFECT 
--------------

BOOLSIDEFFECT, Extrinsic ($$), External call ($&) or $INCREMENT() with potential side effects in Boolean expression

Compile Time Warning: This optional message, accompanied by a line and column pointing to the issue, indicates a Boolean expression that contains a side effect in a term other than its first. By default, YottaDB may skip evaluating such terms.

Action: Revise the code to your standards and use the VIEW (arguments [NO]FULL_BOOLEAN or FULLBOOL_WARN) command and / or the environment variable (gtm_boolean) to select the appropriate setting for YottaDB handling of this construct.

-------------
BOVTMGTEOVTM
-------------

BOVTMGTEOVTM, Journal file xxxx has beginning timestamp aaaa greater than end timestamp bbbb

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the beginning time stamp aaaa of the journal file xxxx is greater than the ending timestamp bbbb. This could be due to something that changed the system time while journaling was going on.

Action: Changing system time during YottaDB run-time is not allowed. Contact your YottaDB support channel for further assistance.

--------------

Action: Report this database cache error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

-------------
BUFFLUFAILED 
-------------

BUFFLUFAILED, Errors flushing buffers from uuuu for database file dddd

DSE/MUPIP Error: MUPIP or DSE (uuuu) could not flush the buffers for database file dddd completely. In the case of MUPIP, this typically means that some process is not releasing the critical section. In the case of DSE, this typically means there is some error in the global buffer cache which needs to be fixed.

Action: In the case of MUPIP, wait approximately 20 seconds and retry. In the case of DSE, try DSE CACHE RECOVER to fix the cache. If the error persists, report it to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation as soon as possible.


---------------
BUFOWNERSTUCK
---------------

BUFOWNERSTUCK, PID xxxx waiting for PID yyyy to finish disk read of block zzzz. Been waiting for aaaa minutes.

Run Time Warning: Poor response time from the I/O subsystem could cause this error, or if the process performing the disk-read was suspended.

Action: If the disk-reading process is found to be in a process-suspended state, un-suspend it. If it is not suspended, examine the I/O subsystem performance characteristics for behavior problems. Report the full error message, along with the operator log messages during the specific timeframe, to your YottaDB support channel.

---------------

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB does not currently support this feature.

Action: -


-------------
CETOOLONG 
-------------

CETOOLONG, Compiler escape substitution exceeds maximum line size

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that the length of the substitution string exceeds the maximum line length.

Action: Determine whether the input source file can be modified to have less source on the line in question. If this is not possible, modify the substitution mechanism design or implementation.


--------------
CETOOMANY
--------------

CETOOMANY, Too many compiler escape substitutions in a single statement

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that the program being compiled contained more nested substitutions than allowed; that is 1024.

Action: Reduce the number of substitutions to less than 1024.


------------

Action: None Required

------------------
CHNGTPRSLVTM 
------------------

CHNGTPRSLVTM, Mupip will change tp_resolve_time from xxxx to yyyy because expected EPOCH or EOF record was not found in Journal File zzzz.

MUPIP Information: At startup, backward recovery/rollback internally computes a time called the tp_resolve_time which is until when backward processing will be performed across journal files of all regions. During backward processing it is possible in very rare cases that recovery does not see an EPOCH record or an EOF record as the last record in the journal file of those regions that had not been updated for quite a long time. In such cases recovery reduces the tp_resolve_time further by taking into account the timestamp of the last journal record. This effectively causes further backward processing but is necessary for a clean recovery. A CHNGTPRSLVTM message is printed whenever such journal files are encountered by backward recovery.

Action: None necessary


------------------
CHSETALREADY
------------------

CHSETALREADY, CHSETALREADY, Socket device already contains sockets with iCHSET=xxxx, oCHSET=xxxx

Run Time Error: The code tried to create a new socket, specifying a CHSET different than the CHSET previously assigned to the SOCKET device.

Action: If different CHSETs are needed for different sockets, place them in different SOCKET devices. Also, if the CHSET of the SOCKET device needs to be changed, it can be done with OPEN/USE command which doesn't create a new socket.

----------------
CIDIRECTIVE 
----------------
CIDIRECTIVE, Invalid directive parameter passing. Expected I, O or IO.

Syntax Error: This indicates that a missing directive or syntactically invalid directive found for the parameter, pointed to by the previous messages EXTSRCLIN and EXTSRCLOC.

Action: One of the directives I, O or IO should be specified for the parameter in the entry displayed.


------------------
CIENTNAME
------------------

CIENTNAME, No label reference found for this entry in call-in table

Syntax/Call in Error: This indicates that a label reference to the M routine is missing or syntactically invalid for an entry in the call-in table (specified by GTMCI environment variable)

Action: Correct the syntax errors in the call-in table entry, at the location pointed to by the two previous messages (EXTSRCLIN and EXTSRCLOC), displaying the line and the column number respectively.

Make sure a valid M label reference is bound to the C call-name specified for this entry.


--------------------
CIMAXLEVELS 
--------------------

CIMAXLEVELS, Too many nested Call-ins. Nested resources exhaused at level !UL.>/error/fao=1!/ansi=0

Call in/Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB runs out of its internal condition handlers stack due to too many levels of nested call-ins.

Action: Ensure that the call-in application is not nested more than the limit (xxxx) that YottaDB supports. The number of nested call-ins can be reduced by not using call-ins, wherever possible, from external call functions.


-----------------------
CIMAXPARAM
-----------------------

CIMAXPARAM, Exceeded maximum number of parameters in the call-in table entry. An M routine cannot accept more than 32 parameters.

Call in/Run Time Error: This indicates that the call-in table specified by $GTMCI contains more than 32 parameters. Since an M formallist can only accept up-to 32 parameters, user cannot pass more than 32 arguments to gtm_ci(), excluding <c-call-name> and <ret-type>.

Action: Reduce the number of parameters to be less than 32, in the call-in table as well in the M routine.

----------------------
CINOENTRY 
----------------------

CINOENTRY, No entry specified for xxxx in the call-in table

Run Time Error: This indicates that the call-name invoked by the C program does not have a corresponding entry in the call-in table specified by GTMCI environment variable.

Action: Add an entry to the call-in table for the call-name. Refer to the `External Calls chapter in the Programmer's Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/ProgrammersGuide/langfeat.html#external-calls>`_.

All YottaDB Components Error: A command string SSSS of BBBB bytes exceeds the maximum supported command line length of MMMM

Action: Reduce the line length, by using unambiguous abbreviations or shortening names.

-----------------
CLOSEFAIL
-----------------

CLOSEFAIL, Error while closing file descriptor dddd

Run Time Error: YottaDB records this error in the syslog whenever it attempts to close an open file descriptor dddd and the close returns with an error. After recording this error, the YottaDB process resumes normal operation.

Action: Report the above error message along with the accompanying GTM-I-CALLERID message to your YottaDB support channel, as it may be a symptom of out-of-design operation.


---------------
CLSTCONFLICT 
---------------

CLSTCONFLICT, Cluster conflict opening database file xxxx; could not secure access. Already open on node yyyy.

Run Time Error: This indicates that the process attempted to access non-clustered database xxxx, which was opened by node yyyy.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information. Move the process to the appropriate node or use GDE to change the mapping in the Global Directory.

This error message can also occur after a database is improperly shut down. Perform a MUPIP RUNDOWN with a FILE or REGION qualifier.


----------------
CMD
----------------

CMD, Command expected but not found

Compile Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB encountered something other than a command- the next valid syntax element. This error can occur when there is an invalid character in the middle of a variable name or keyword, such as in the M line S X=Y_$B or in the command W "this is a tab <TAB>".

Action: Verify the line syntax. Replace the line if it contains invisible (non-graphic) characters because diagnosing the line syntax may prove time consuming.

------------
CMEXCDASTLM 
------------

CMEXCDASTLM, Exceeded AST limit. Cannot open database.

GT.CM Error: This indicates that the GT.CM server exceeded its quota of asynchronous system traps (ASTs).

Run Time Error: Strings longer than 32,767  bytes have been used with alternative collation and only gtm_ac_xform and gtm_ac_xback are defined in the collation library.

Action: Define gtm_ac_xfrom_1 and gtm_ac_xback_1 routines in the collation library.

----------------
COLLATIONUNDEF 
----------------

COLLATIONUNDEF, Collation type xxxx is not defined

Run Time Error: This indicates that an attempt was made to reference a collation sequence that is not available.

Action: Ensure that the environment variable GTM_COLLATE_n is properly defined, where n is the identification number of the failing collation type. Ensure that the file referencing GTM_COLLATE_n is available to the process. Use host shell commands to verify its location and protections. Examine the executable (and/or the objects that comprise it) to determine whether it has the proper entry points. For more information, refer to the `"Internationalization" chapter of the Programmer's Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/ProgrammersGuide/internatn.html>`_.

----------------
COLLDATAEXISTS
----------------

COLLDATAEXISTS, Collation type cannot be changed while data exists

Run Time Error: This indicates that an attempt was made to change the local collation type while local variables exist.

Action: KILL or NEW the local variables before you change the local collation type.


----------------
COLLFNMISSING 
----------------

COLLFNMISSING, Routine xxx is not found for collation sequence nnn

Run Time Error: Required transformation back routine is missing in collation library.

Action: If gtm_ac_xfrom_1 is defined, also define gtm_ac_xback_1. Or if gtm_ac_xform is defined, also define gtm_ac_xback in the collation library.

-----------------
COLLTYPVERSION
-----------------

COLLTYPVERSION, Collation type xxxx, version yyyy mismatch

Run Time Error: This indicates that the user image with collation type xxxx does not accept the version of collation for an existing global. yyyy is the version associated with the global.

Action: Review the implementation history of the current collation algorithm. Modify or replace the image, if appropriate. If the version should change, temporarily RESTORE the older matching module, unLOAD and KILL any globals using the older algorithms, RESTORE the new algorithms, and reLOAD the global.

--------------
COLON 
--------------

COLON, Colon (:) expected in this context

Compile Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB did not encounter a colon where expected.

Action: Look for a $SELECT() function that does not have a colon separating the conditional expression from its corresponding value expression. Also, look for a ZGOTO that is missing a colon between the level and an entry reference.


----------------
COLTRANSSTR2LONG
----------------

COLTRANSSTR2LONG, COLTRANSSTR2LONG,Output string after collation transformation is too long

Run Time Error: an alternative collation transform or reverse transform attempted to use more bytes than the configuration permits.

Action: Adjust the implementation of the collation transform to minimize key expansion; increase the maximum permitted key size if appropriate. Note the current supported maximum is 1019 bytes. If the key size is already maxed out and the transformation algorithm is optimal, you must modify the application to reduce the key size.


----------------
COMMA 
----------------

COMMA, comma expected in this context

Compile Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB did not encounter a comma where expected.

Action: Look for a missing argument or comma in a function that requires multiple arguments.


-----------------
COMMAORRPAREXP
-----------------

COMMAORRPAREXP, Comma or right parenthesis expected but not found

Compile Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB did not encounter a comma or right parenthesis where expected.

Action: Look for a list of improperly formatted subscripts, arguments, or parameters.


----------------
COMMENT 
----------------

COMMENT, Comment line. Placed zbreak at next executable line.

Run Time Information: This indicates that a ZBREAK specified a line that had no active code. Therefore, YottaDB set the ZBREAK at the next line containing source code.

Action: -

----------------
COMMITWAITPID
----------------

COMMITWAITPID, Pid wwww waited tttt minute(s) for pid pppp to finish commits in database file dddd

Run Time Warning: This warning message in the operator log indicates the total amount of time that the process wwww waited for another process pppp to finish database transaction commit. If the $gtm_procstuckexec mechanism is enabled, this message invokes it. If a process waits for more than one process to finish database transaction commits, it issues this message for each one it encounters.

Action: If the process pppp is still running, get a C-stack trace of the process (using a debugger) and report to your YottaDB support channel with system log and operator log information.


--------------------
COMMITWAITSTUCK 
--------------------

COMMITWAITSTUCK, Pid wwww timed out after waiting tttt minute(s) for nnnn concurrent YottaDB process(es) to finish commits in database file dddd

Run Time Error: This error message indicates that a process could not finish database transaction commit and timed out waiting for other concurrent processes to finish.

Action: Check the operator log for accompanying COMMITWAITPID messages. Every concurrent YottaDB processes reported with the COMMITWAITSTUCK messages would have accompanying COMMITWAITPID message(s). If so, review those messages. If not, report to your YottaDB support channel with system log and operator log information.

----------------
COMPILEQUALS 
----------------

COMPILEQUALS, Error in compiler qualifiers: xxxx

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that a run-time compilation specified an invalid qualifier (xxxx). Qualifiers for a run-time compilation can be specified with ZLINK or by setting $ZCOMPILE to a qualifier string that YottaDB uses for auto-ZLINKs with no qualifiers.

Action: Review the qualifiers in the ZLINK sub-argument or those being SET into $ZCOMPILE.

---------------
CONNSOCKREQ 
---------------

CONNSOCKREQ, CONNSOCKREQ, Socket not connected

Run Time Error: The operation attempted requires a socket in the CONNECTED state, and the provided socket was not connected.

Action: Make sure the correct socket is being used and that the socket is connected. ZSHOW "D" may provide useful details on the current socket state.

--------------------
COREINPROGRESS 
--------------------

COREINPROGRESS, Previous core attempt failed; core generation bypassed.

Run Time Error: This indicates that the process, which failed, was unable to create a memory dump file and tried to create another one.

Action: Report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel for further analysis.

--------------------------

CORRUPTNODE, Corrupt input in Record # rrrr, Key #yyyy; resuming with next global node

MUPIP Error: This message reports record rrrr with apparent key kkkk does not have a valid format for MUPIP LOAD.

Action: USE %GO or MUPIP EXTRACT to recapture the problematic node(s), or, use an editor to create valid copies of the nodes in an LOAD file.

-----------------------------
CPBEYALLOC 
-----------------------------

CPBEYALLOC, Attempt to copy beyond the allocated buffer

DSE Error: This indicates that DSE tried to add a record that did not fit into the block size and/or the balanced tree structure.

Action: Check the block size. Move or create the record in a different location.

---------------------------
CREDNOTPASSED
---------------------------

CREDNOTPASSED, CREDNOTPASSED, Socket message contained no passed credentials

Run Time Error: WRITE /PASS or WRITE /ACCEPT was given a process id to verify, but YottaDB was unable to obtain the peerprocess id.

Action: See the accompanying ENO error for details.

------------------------
CRITRESET 
------------------------

CRITRESET, The critical section crash count for region xxxx has been incremented

Run Time Fatal: This indicates that the critical section for region xxxx was reset by the DSE command CRITICAL with the qualifiers INIT and RESET, while this process was accessing that database.

Action: Wait until the DSE repair operations are complete before retrying or restarting the process.

-------------------------
CRITSEMFAIL 
-------------------------

CRITSEMFAIL, Error with semaphores for region xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB encountered a missing or damaged semaphore. This typically indicates that an agent external to YottaDB has deleted or modified the semaphores YottaDB uses to manage database and LOCK interactions.

Action: Investigate the state of the YottaDB semaphores and all previous actions that might have damaged them.

-------------------
CRYPTBADCONFIG
-------------------

CRYPTBADCONFIG, Could not retrieve data from encrypted file ffff due to bad encryption configuration. eeee

Run Time Error: The error occurs when a YottaDB utility program starts with a bad encryption configuration (like a bad password) and attempts to read a block corresponding to file ffff (either from memory or disk).

Action: Look at accompanying message (or prior messages related to encryption) for more details on what encryption configuration parameter is incorrect.

-------------------
CRYPTBADWRTPOS
-------------------

CRYPTBADWRTPOS, CRYPTBADWRTPOS, Encrypted WRITE disallowed from a position different than where the last WRITE completed

Run Time Error: A WRITE attempt to an encrypted device violates the integrity of the produced ciphertext. This is the case, for example, when trying to WRITE to a previously encrypted and CLOSEd file. Because encryption ciphers rely on state machine algorithms, YottaDB prohibits WRITEs performed in non-sequential fashion or when they threaten to overlay already encrypted data.

Action: Revise your M code to avoid illegal I/O operations with encryption. Note, in particular, that when using encryption non-empty files cannot be opened in APPEND mode; the SEEK deviceparameter is prohibited; and the TRUNCATE is only permitted at the beginning or end of a file.

-----------------------
CRYPTDLNOOPEN 
-----------------------

CRYPTDLNOOPEN, Failed to load encryption library while opening encrypted file ffff. eeee

Run Time Error: YottaDB failed to load the gtmcrypt plug-in or one of its related libraries.

Run Time Error: The gtmcrypt plug-in reports it is unable to initialize one or more of its related libraries during YottaDB startup.

Action: Examine the detailed message (eeee) from the plug-in and take appropriate action.

------------------
CRYPTJNLMISMATCH
------------------

CRYPTJNLMISMATCH, Encryption settings mismatch between journal file jjjj and corresponding database file dddd

All YottaDB Components Error: Encryption settings in the header of database file dddd do not match those stored in the header of journal file jjjj. This is most likely caused by inappropriate operator action such as replacing the current journal file with an older journal file.

Action: Correct the error that caused the incorrect journal file to be pointed to by the database file. If the correct journal file has been inadvertently deleted, create new journal files with the -noprevjnl switch. Take a backup as soon as possible thereafter. Depending on your situation, you may need to refresh secondary instances.


-----------------
CRYPTJNLWRONGHASH
-----------------

CRYPTJNLWRONGHASH, Encryption key hash mismatch between journal file jjjj and corresponding database file dddd

Run Time Error: gtmcrypt plug-in reports the hash of the key in the header of database file dddd does not match the hash stored in the header of journal file jjjj. This is most likely caused by inappropriate operator action such as replacing the current journal file with an older journal file.

Action: Correct the error that caused the incorrect journal file to be pointed to by the database file. If the correct journal file has been inadvertently deleted, create new journal files with the -noprevjnl switch. Take a backup as soon as possible thereafter. Depending on your situation, you may need to refresh secondary instances.

--------------------
CRYPTKEYFETCHFAILED
--------------------

CRYPTKEYFETCHFAILED, Failed to retrieve encryption key corresponding to file ffff. eeee

Run Time Error: gtmcrypt plug-in reports it was unable to obtain an encryption key for file ffff.

Action: Examine the message (eeee) from the plug-in and take the needed action: for example, verify encryption key for this file is pointed to by the database key file, verify proper permissions on the directory path and the file, and so on. Also, make sure that there is an appropriate maximum process limit because obtaining an encryption key may fork other processes.

---------------------
CRYPTKEYFETCHFAILEDNF
---------------------

CRYPTKEYFETCHFAILEDNF, Cannot obtain encryption key. xxxx

Run Time Error: gtmcrypt plug-in reports it was unable to obtain an encryption key based upon matching the hash of an encryption key.

Action: Examine the message (xxxx) from the plug-in and take the needed action: for example, verify encryption keys for all database files are pointed to by the database key file. For extracts and backups, verify all the keys from the databases that provided records are in the database key file.

---------------------
CRYPTKEYRELEASEFAILED
---------------------

CRYPTKEYRELEASEFAILED, Could not safely release encryption key corresponding to file ffff. eeee

All YottaDB Components Error: gtmcrypt plug-in reports that it is unable to release the memory pertaining to the encryption key associated with file ffff due to error eeee

Action: Examine message eeee from the plug-in and take the needed action: for example, ensure that the memory is accessible, process has correct permissions, and so on.

-----------------------
CRYPTKEYTOOBIG
-----------------------

CRYPTKEYTOOBIG, CRYPTKEYTOOBIG, Specified key has length xxxx, which is greater than the maximum allowed key length yyyy

Run Time Error: A key name value specified with the [I|O]KEY deviceparameter on an OPEN or USE command is too long.

Action: Verify that the key name portion of the [I|O]KEY deviceparameter's value (substring before the first space, if any) corresponds to an existing field name in the 'database.keys' or 'files' section of the configuration file and does not exceed yyyy characters in length.


-------------------
CRYPTNOAPPEND
-------------------

CRYPTNOAPPEND, CRYPTNOAPPEND, APPEND disallowed on the encrypted file xxxx

Run Time Error: An OPEN command specifies both an APPEND deviceparameter and a non-empty value for the [I|O]KEY deviceparameter.

Action: Because encryption algorithms maintain state as they process text, APPENDing encrypted data to a non-empty file is prohibited; revise your application code accordingly.

----------------------
CRYPTNOKEY 
----------------------

CRYPTNOKEY, No encryption key specified

MUPIP Error: MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT prints this message if no encryption key is specified.

Action: Provide the requisite encryption key to the command as instructed in YottaDB documentation.

-------------------
CRYPTNOKEYSPEC 
-------------------

CRYPTNOKEYSPEC, Key name needs to be specified with KEY, IKEY, or OKEY device parameter for encrypted I/O

Run Time Error: A key name value specified with the [I|O]KEY deviceparameter on an OPEN or USE command is empty while the initialization vector (IV) is not.

Action: If enabling encryption or modifying encryption attributes, be sure to include an appropriate key name; if disabling encryption, leave the IV portion of the [I|O]KEY deviceparameter's value (substring after the first space) empty.

----------------
CRYPTNOMM 
----------------

CRYPTNOMM, ffff is an encrypted database. Cannot support MM access method.

MUPIP Error: This error is triggered by an attempt to mark an MM database as encrypted with GDE or to switch an encrypted database from BG to MM with MUPIP SET. The MM access method is not supported for encrypted databases.

Action: Use the BG access method for encrypted files.

---------------
CRYPTNOOVERRIDE
---------------

CRYPTNOOVERRIDE, Cannot override IVEC and/or key without compromising integrity

Run Time Error: An OPEN or USE command attempts to change the encryption attributes - that is: attempted to enable or disable encryption or change the key name, initialization vector (IV), or both, after a prior encrypted READ or WRITE.

Action: Because encryption algorithms maintain state as they process text, changing encryption attributes of a device is prohibited if an encrypted READ or WRITE has already occurred, so revise your application code accordingly.

------------------
CRYPTNOPSWDINTP
------------------

CRYPTNOPSWDINTP, Cannot prompt for password inside a TP transaction.

Run Time Error: This error occurs if the process used an external call to set the gtm_passwd environment variable to null string after startup and then accessed an encrypted database file for the first time within a TP transaction.

Action: If possible, set the gtm_passwd environment variable to the obfuscated password. Otherwise, revise the logic to touch a global mapped to each encrypted database, for example, $DATA(myglobal), to ensure the prompting happens before entering any TP transaction.


---------------------
CRYPTNOSEEK 
---------------------

CRYPTNOSEEK, SEEK disallowed on the encrypted file ffff

Run Time Error: An OPEN or USE command specifies a SEEK deviceparameter on an encryption-enabled device.

Action: Because encryption algorithms maintain state as they process text, SEEKs are prohibited with encrypted devices, so revise your application code accordingly.

-----------------
CRYPTNOTRUNC
-----------------

CRYPTNOTRUNC, Not positioned at file start or EOF. TRUNCATE disallowed on the encrypted file ffff

Run Time Error: An OPEN or USE command specifies a TRUNCATE deviceparameter on a encryption-enabled device which is not positioned at the end of a file.

Action: When using encryption, because encryption algorithms maintain state as they process text, a TRUNCATE is only permitted at the beginning or end of a file, the former deleting the entire contents, and the latter effectively a no-op.

-------------------
CRYPTNOV4 
-------------------

CRYPTNOV4, ffff is an encrypted database. Cannot downgrade with Encryption option enabled.>/error/fao=2!/ansi=0

MUPIP Error: An attempt to downgrade ffff which is an encrypted database to the previous format failed because it does not support encrypted database files.

Action: Use the database in the current format. If an older format is required, extract the data in unencrypted ZWRite format with MUPIP EXTRACT and load it into a newly created database.

--------------------
CRYPTOPFAILED 
--------------------

CRYPTOPFAILED, Encrypt/Decrypt operation failed for file ffff. eeee

Action: YottaDB often fixes this error unless there is a serious problem causing this error. If there is a serious problem, the accompanying messages identify the cause.

--------------------
DBADDRANGE8 
--------------------

DBADDRANGE8, Database file xxxx, element location yyyy: control zzzz was outside aaaa range bbbb to cccc.

Run Time Error: This message is the same as a DBADDRANGE message except that bbb8 and ccc8 are 8-byte quantities (as opposed to 4-byte quantitites in DBADDRANGE).

Action: YottaDB often fixes this error unless there is a serious problem causing this error. If there is a serious problem, the accompanying messages identify the cause.

----------------------
DBBADFREEBLKCTR 
----------------------

DBBADFREEBLKCTR, Database xxxx free blocks counter in file header: oooo appears incorrect; should be nnnn. Auto-corrected.

Run Time Warning: This indicates that during a file extension, because they differed, YottaDB adjusted the free blocks counter (oooo) in the file header to agree with free blocks indicated by the master map (nnnn). Because this may indicate a master bitmap integrity error (DBMBPINCFL), check the next MUPIP INTEG carefully.

Action: Run MUPIP INTEG; if it reports a DBMBPINCFL integrity error, use DSE to correct it, and to increase the file header free blocks counter by the amount YottaDB reduced it in the DBBADFREEBLKCTR message. Run an additional INTEG to confirm the corrections.

----------------------

MUPIP Information: MUPIP INTEG has corrected the blocks-to-upgrade field.

Action: Report this to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

-------------------
DBBTUWRNG
-------------------

DBBTUWRNG, The blocks-to-upgrade file-header field is incorrect. Expected xxxx, found yyyy

MUPIP Error: The "Blocks to Upgrade" counter was found to be incorrect by MUPIP INTEG (this is only checked for non-FAST integs).

Action: If there are no other integrity errors, MUPIP INTEG will repair the counter. If there are other integrity errors, fix those errors first, then rerun MUPIP INTEG which will repair the counter if it is still found to be in error. Although this error is not indicative of any specific kind of database damage it does represent an out-of-design condition (except following a system crash in which before image journaling was not in use) that your YottaDB support channel would like to know about.

----------------------
DBCBADFILE 
----------------------

DBCBADFILE, Source file xxx does not appear to have been generated by DBCERTIFY SCAN - rerun SCAN or specify correct file

DBCERTIFY Error: V5CBSU and DBCERTIFY CERTIFY require the output file from DBCERTIFY SCAN. The file which was specified is not in the correct format.

Action: Specify the file created by DBCERTIFY SCAN. Rerun DBCERTIFY SCAN if needed.

-------------------
DBCCERR
-------------------

DBCCERR, Interlock instruction failure in critical mechanism for region xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that an interlocked operation for the specified region failed.

Action: Report this database concurrency error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.


---------------------
DBCCMDFAIL
---------------------

DBCCMDFAIL, Executed command failed with return code xxxx yyyy which executed yyyy yyyy

DBCERTIFY Error: During processing, the DBCERTIFY attempts to execute certain DSE and/or MUPIP commands in temporary command scripts that DBCERTIFY creates. The specified command failed to execute.

Action: The action to take depends on the code returned by the attempt and if any associated messages were created on either the console or the operator log. Some common causes of problems could be that $gtm_dist (UNIX) is not properly pointing to the current YottaDB version or DBCERTIFY has no access or access to the wrong global directory for which it is executing commands.

---------------------------
DBCDBCERTIFIED 
---------------------------

DBCDBCERTIFIED, Database xxx has been certified for use with xxxx

DBCERTIFY Information: DBCERTIFY CERTIFY has successfully completed and marked the database as certified for use by the specified YottaDB version.

Action: Either keep running the current YottaDB version or proceed immediately to YottaDB MUPIP UPGRADE at user's discretion.

---------------------
DBCDBNOCERTIFY
---------------------

DBCDBNOCERTIFY, Database xxxx HAS NOT been certified due to the preceding errors - rerun DBCERTIFY SCAN

MUPIP Error: MUPIP UPGRADE triggers this error if it finds the DBCERTIFY CERTIFY command has not run to completion on database xxx.

Action: Complete the scan phase of DBCERTIFY by executing the DBCERTIFY SCAN command.

------------------
DBCINTEGERR
------------------

DBCINTEGERR, Encountered integrity error in database xxxx

DBCERTIFY Error: DBCERTIFY discovered what appears to be an integrity error while processing the specified database. This error is accompanied by a secondary message giving an explanation of what the error is.

Action: Run a MUPIP INTEG (not FAST integ) on the database in question; fix damage, then re-run the phase reporting the error. If the integrity error persists, contact your YottaDB support channel.

---------------
DBCKILLIP 
---------------

DBCKILLIP, Cannot proceed with kill-in-progress indicator set for database xxx

DBCERTIFY Error: DBCERTIFY discovered that the kill in progress indicator was on for the specified database. DBCERTIFY will not process a database with this indicator on.

Action: Run a MUPIP INTEG (FAST integ is OK) on the database in question; correct errors, then re-run the phase reporting the error. If the error persists, contact your YottaDB support channel.

----------------
DBCLNUPINFO 
----------------

DBCLNUPINFO, Database file xxxx / yyyy

Run Time Information: When a process that holds the critical section lock on one or more databases gets abnormally terminated, it dumps information pertaining to its current state into the global sections for each of the concerned databases. The next process that references the concerned database notices the previous abnormal termination and uses the dumped information to update the global buffers and takes the database to a safe and consistent state. During this transition, the process displays a subset of the dumped information in the operator log to be used for debugging purposes by your YottaDB support channel, in case database integrity errors are experienced later.

Action: The message text describes the cause of this error. Report any database structure errors to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

------------------
DBCMODBLK2BIG 
------------------

DBCMODBLK2BIG, Block 0xaaa has been modified since DCERTIFY SCAN but is still too large or has an earlier TN than in DCERTIFY SCAN - Rerun scan

DBCERTIFY Error: DBCERTIFY reports this error when the block it is processing has a different TN than it did in the scan phase yet the block is still too large.

Action: This condition indicates that something has been done to the database since the scan phase was run - either it was restored from an earlier backup or the reserved bytes value was (even temporarily) reduced. DBCERTIFY SCAN must be rerun.

------------------
DBCMPBAD 
------------------

DBCMPBAD, xxxx yyyy Compression count not maximal

Run Time Warning: This indicates that a database operation failed because block xxxx contains a record at offset yyyy with a compression count that is too low.

Action: Report this database structure error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

------------------
DBCMPMX 
------------------

DBCMPMX, xxxx yyyy Record compression count is too large

Run Time Warning: This indicates that during block certification or DSE/MUPIP integrity check, the block xxxx was found to contain a record at offset yyyy that exceeds the compression count.

Action: Report this database structure error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

-----------------
DBCMPNZRO 
-----------------

DBCMPNZRO, xxxx yyyy First record of block has nonzero compression count

Run Time Warning: This indicates that during block certification or DSE/MUPIP integrity check the first record at offset yyyy of block xxxx was found to have a nonzero compression count.

Action: Report this database structure error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

-------------------
DBCNOEXTND
-------------------

DBCNOEXTND, Unable to extend database xxx

DBCERTIFY Error: DBCERTIFY attempted to use MUPIP EXTEND to extend the database but the attempt failed.

Action: Examine the accompanying messages from the MUPIP EXTEND attempt to see why the extend failed. A common cause for this is that $gtm_dist did not properly point to the currently installed distribution, or there was insufficient disk space to perform the expansion.

------------------
DBCNOFINISH
------------------

DBCNOFINISH, DBCERTIFY unable to finish all requested actions

DBCERTIFY Error: This indicates DBCERTIFY encountered an error, which prevented the requested action from completing. The action has partially completed.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information to identify the cause.

------------------
DBCNOTSAMEDB 
------------------

DBCNOTSAMEDB, Database has been moved or restored since DBCERTIFY SCAN - Rerun scan

DBCERTIFY Error: DBCERTIFY has noted that the unique database identifiers for the database have changed since DBCERTIFY SCAN was run.

Action: The database is required to have not been moved around or restored or recovered since DBCERTIFY SCAN was run. DBCERTIFY SCAN must be rerun.

-------------
DBCNTRLERR
-------------

DBCNTRLERR, Database file xxxx: control error suspected but not found

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB detected the possibility of damage to database cache structures and performed a cache verification and rebuild, but found no evidence of damage.

Action: Verify that there are no locked or runaway processes. Check disk loads for evidence of resource constraints.

------------------
DBCOLLREQ
------------------

DBCOLLREQ, JOURNAL EXTRACT proceeding without collation information for globals in database. eeee ffff .

MUPIP Warning: This is MUPIP JOURNAL EXTRACT Warning. This indicates that MUPIP process uses the default collation as it is not able to read the database file ffff because of error eeee

Action: Be aware that if the EXTRACT contains variables with alternative collation that this extract represents them as YottaDB stores them, rather than as they are used by the application. Attempting to LOAD such an EXTRACT will produce incorrect results.

----------------
DBCOMMITCLNUP 
----------------

DBCOMMITCLNUP, Pid dddd [hhhh] handled error (code = eeee) during commit of xxxx transaction in database file yyyy

Success Information: This message is output to the operator log and indicates that there was an error in the midst of committing a xxxx (TP or non-TP) transaction that involved the database file yyyy, but the process (pid = dddd in decimal and hhhh in hexadecimal) handled the error and completed the commit. If non-zero, the error code eeee is what triggered the error in the first place. If zero, accompanying syslog messages will contain information on the cause.

Action: In most cases the commit will be successfully completed. But in very rare cases, there might be errors that prevent the transaction from being successfully completed. To determine if there was any error, examine the following operator log messages. If there are more then 3 (three) DBCLNUPINFO messages for the same database file from the same process-id, then that particular database is suspect and an integrity check of that database needs to be done at the earliest. In addition, contact your YottaDB support channel with the operator log messages.

-----------------
DBCOMPTOOLRG
-----------------

DBCOMPTOOLRG, xxxx Record has too large compression count

MUPIP Error: This is a MUPIP INTEG error. Refer to the topic `MUPIP INTEG Errors in the About This Manual section <https://docs.yottadb.com/MessageRecovery/about.html#mupip-integ-errors>`_.

Action: -

--------------
DBCREC2BIG
--------------

DBCREC2BIG, Record with key xxx is length yyy in block 0xaaa is greater than the maximum length yyy in database xxx

DBCERTIFY Error: DBCERTIFY has identified a record with the given key in the given block with a length that exceeds the maximum length allowed in the given database.

Action: This is typically due to the user reducing the maximum record length to meet the DBCERTIFY requirements but not verifying that no records exist that exceeds that length. The solution is to either delete or otherwise restructure the record or to MUPIP extract/load into a database with a larger blocksize.

----------------
DBCREC2BIGINBLK
----------------

DBCREC2BIGINBLK, A Record in block bbbb has a length greater than the maximum uuuuu in database dddd.

MUPIP Error: MUPIP UPGRADE triggers this error when the size of a record in block bbbb exceeds the maximum record size of uuuu in database region dddd.

Action: -


----------------
DBCREINCOMP 
----------------

DBCREINCOMP, xxxx Header indicates database file creation was interrupted before completion

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This is either a MUPIP Integ error, or this indicates that a database operation tried to activate a database file that was improperly initialized.

Action: Delete the damaged file and use MUPIP CREATE to recreate the database. Refer to `'MUPIP INTEG Error Messages' table in Chapter 11 - Maintaining Database Integrity of the Administration and Operations Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/integrity.html>`_.

Run Time Error: This usually indicates that a process was abnormally terminated and left database control structures in an inconsistent state in shared memory.

Action: YottaDB often fixes this error unless there is a more serious problem causing this error. If there is a more serious problem, accompanying messages identify the cause.

------------------
DBCRERR8 
------------------

DBCRERR8, Database file xxxx, or location yyyy blk = zzzz error: aaaa was bbbb, expecting cccc -- called from module yyy at line xxx

Run Time Error: This message is the same as a DBCRERR message except that bbbb and cccc are 8-byte quantities (as opposed to 4-byte quantitites in DBCRERR). See Error description for message DBCRERR.

Action: YottaDB often fixes this error unless there is a more serious problem causing this error. If there is a more serious problem, accompanying messages identify the cause.

-------------------
DBCSCNNOTCMPLT 
-------------------

DBCSCNNOTCMPLT, Specified DBCERTIFY SCAN output file is not complete - Rerun scan

DBCERTIFY Error: DBCERTIFY CERTIFY has noted that the header of the scan phase output is not filled in indicating that the scan phase did not complete normally.

Action: Rerun DBCERTIFY SCAN to produce a complete output file for the certify phase to process.

-------------------
DBDANGER 
-------------------

DBDANGER, Process pppp killed while committing update for database file xxxx. Possibility of damage to block yyyy.

Run Time Warning: This message is issued when a recovery of the database global buffer cache structures needs to be performed. It might discover that the cache recovery was necessary because of a YottaDB process being killed (kill-9) while in the process of committing a change to the database. The cache recovery routine issues this message while proceeding with the recovery.

Action: This is a warning type message indicating possible database corruption due to process kills (kill-9). A database integrity check is recommended. Make sure that kill-9 or STOP/ID is not used to stop any YottaDB processes.

-------------------
DBDATAMX 
-------------------

DBDATAMX, xxxx Record too large

MUPIP Error: This is a MUPIP INTEG error. Refer to the `MUPIP INTEG Errors section <https://docs.yottadb.com/MessageRecovery/about.html#mupip-integ-errors>`_.

Action: N/A

-------------------
DBDIRTSUBSC
-------------------

DBDIRTSUBSC, <xxxx Directory tree block contains non name-level entries>

DSE/Run Time Information: This indicates that the specified database block has an internal structural damage since it contains subscripts global variable names even though this block is part of the directory tree.

Action: Report this database structure error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

------------------
DBDSRDFMTCHNG 
------------------

DBDSRDFMTCHNG, Database file xxx, Desired DB Format set to yyy by zzz with pid ppp [0xppp] at transaction number [0xttt]

MUPIP Information: The desired database block format has been changed to version yyy for database file xxx by the zzz command with process number ppp at transaction number ttt.

Action: N/A

--------------------
DBDUPNULCOL 
--------------------

DBDUPNULCOL, Discarding kkkk=vvvv key due to duplicate null collation record

MUPIP Error: This idicates that MUPIP LOAD discarded a key-value pair from a binary EXTRACT because it contained conflicting empty string subscripts. This can only happen is someone changes the "Null" subscript representation used by a database while it contains such subscripts. YottaDB recommends against such a change.

Action: Determine whether the described data has value and restore it, typically with a SET command, appropriately.

--------------------
DBENDIAN 
--------------------

DBENDIAN, Database file xxxx is aaaa endian on a gggg endian system

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that the database file being opened is in the wrong endian format for the current system. This usually means that the file was copied from another system with the opposite endian format.

Action: To use the database file on the current system, change the endian format using the MUPIP ENDIANCVT command.


--------------------
DBFGTBC
--------------------

DBFGTBC, xxxx File size larger than block count would indicate

MUPIP Error: This is a MUPIP INTEG error. Refer to the topic `MUPIP INTEG Errors in the About This Manual section <https://docs.yottadb.com/MessageRecovery/about.html#mupip-integ-errors>`_.

Action: -

------------------
DBFHEADERR
------------------

DBFHEADERR, Database file xxxx: control problem: yyyy was zzzz expecting aaaa

Run Time Error: This indicates that database cache recovery was triggered due to some abnormal event, and the recovery routine detected damage to the control structures in the database global buffer cache.

Action: The system automatically attempts to correct the problem. If this error continues to occur, attempt MUPIP RUNDOWN and if that fails too, restore database from backup and replay journal files. Report this error to your YottaDB support channel if necessary.


-------------------------
DBFHEADERR4 
-------------------------

DBFHEADERR4, DBFHEADERR4:Database file ffff: control problem: aaaa was xxxx expecting yyyy

Run Time Error: This indicates that database cache recovery was triggered due to some abnormal event, and the recovery routine detected damage to the control structures in the database global buffer cache.

Run Time Error: This indicates that the database manager portion of the run-time system encountered an error when it attempted to open, read, write, or close a database file.

Action: Report this error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation. Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information and analyze the system error log.

------------------
DBFLCORRP
------------------

DBFLCORRP, xxxx Header indicates database file is corrupt

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that a database operation tried to activate database file xxxx, which was previously marked as damaged.

Action: If ROLLBACK (either -NOONLINE or -ONLINE) terminates abnormally (say because of a kill -9), it leaves the database in a potentially inconsistent state indicated by the FILE corrupt field in the database file header. When an ROLLBACK terminates leaving this field set, all other processes receive DBFLCORRP errors any time they attempt to interact with the database. The best way to clear DBFLCORRP is by running another ROLLBACK. MUPIP SET -FILE -PARTIAL_RECOV_BYPASS and DSE CHANGE -FILE -CORRUPT=FALSE -NOCRIT can also clear this condition but these commands do not ensure that the database has consistent state so you should always run MUPIP INTEG after executing these commands.

------------------
DBFREEZEOFF
------------------

DBFREEZEOFF, Region rrrr is UNFROZEN ([NO]OVERRIDE [NO]AUTOREL)

Operator log/MUPIP Information: The database region rrrr is no longer frozen, most likely due to a MUPIP FREEZE -OFF, with the selected options. [NO]AUTOREL indicates whether an autorelease of the region occurred prior to the MUPIP FREEZE -OFF command.

DBCERTIFY/MUPIP Error: DBCERTIFY and MUPIP UPGRADE report this error when the maximum record size is too close to the database blocksize and does not allow room for an expanded block header.

Action: Reduce the maximum record size or mupip extract/load into a database with a larger blocksize. Note that if the maximum record size is reduced with DSE, it is possible that records that exceed the reduced size still exist in the database which is now an integrity error. DBCERTIFY SCAN will find these blocks and report on them if they exist.

--------------
DBMAXRSEXBL
--------------

DBMAXRSEXBL, xxxx Maximum record size for database exceeds what the block size can support

MUPIP Error: This is a MUPIP INTEG error. Refer to the topic `MUPIP INTEG Errors in the About This Manual section <https://docs.yottadb.com/MessageRecovery/about.html#mupip-integ-errors>`_.

MUPIP Error: This is a MUPIP INTEG error. Refer to the topic `MUPIP INTEG Errors in the About This Manual section <https://docs.yottadb.com/MessageRecovery/about.html#mupip-integ-errors>`_.

Action: -

----------------
DBMBMINCFREFIXED
----------------

DBMBMINCFREFIXED, Master bitmap incorrectly marks local bitmap 0xAAAA as free. Auto-corrected.

Run Time Warning: The above error is issued when the runtime engine detects an integrity error with the master map that indicates that the local bitmap 0xAAAA is free when in actually it is not. The error is also auto-corrected by the runtime engine by marking the local bitmap as full in the master bitmap.

MUPIP Error: This is a MUPIP INTEG error. Refer to the topic `MUPIP INTEG Errors in the About This Manual section <https://docs.yottadb.com/MessageRecovery/about.html#mupip-integ-errors>`_.

Action: -

------------------
DBNAMEMISMATCH 
------------------

DBNAMEMISMATCH, Database file xxxx (region (yyyy) referenced by shared memory (ID=zzzz) is not accessible. Ensure region is properly rundown.

Run Time Warning: When a YottaDB process attaches to a database and finds the corresponding shared memory structures already initialized, it performs integrity checks on the shared memory contents to ensure that they correspond back to the database file. When the shared memory points to a database file name that is not valid, this error is issued.

Action: This error means that the shared memory contents are corrupt; consult your YottaDB support channel before proceeding further.

---------------
DBNOCRE
---------------

DBNOCRE, Not all specified databases, or their associated journal files were created

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that MUPIP CREATE failed a task in creating the new database files.

Action: See accompanying messages for more detailed information on the failure.

---------------
DBNONUMSUBS 
---------------

DBNONUMSUBS, kkkk key contains a numeric form of subscript in a global defined to collate all subscripts as strings

Run Time/MUPIP Error: The record has a numeric subscript but the collation setting for the global or region indicates all subscripts are filed as strings. The leading context (XXXX) identifies the block and offest of the problematic record. This can arise if an operator uses DSE to force a change to a collation setting or to modify a key when the global already has content.

Action: If you can determine the cause of, and reason for, the change and you may choose to reverse it. If you need to change the collation, the appropriate procedure is to EXTRACT the data, KILL the global, or remove and recreate the database file, and them LOAD the extracted data.

-----------------
DBNOREGION
-----------------

DBNOREGION, None of the database regions accessible

DSE/MUPIP Error: MUPIP INTEG or DSE can report this error. This indicates that none of the database files specified in the Global Directory could be opened (or they do not exist).

Action: Ensure the proper assignment for the environment variable, gtmglbdir/logical name GTM$GBLDIR. Verify that the database files specified in the Global Directory exist and that their protection allows access. Also, refer to the 'MUPIP INTEG Error Messages' table in the `Chapter 11 - Maintaining Database Integrity of the Administration and Operations Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/integrity.html>`_.

-------------------

MUPIP Error: This is a MUPIP INTEG error. Refer to the topic `MUPIP INTEG Errors in the About This Manual section <https://docs.yottadb.com/MessageRecovery/about.html#mupip-integ-errors>`_.

Action: -

-----------------
DBNOTGDS
-----------------

DBNOTGDS, xxxx - Unrecognized database file format

Run Time Error: This indicates that a database operation attempted to activate file xxxx, which is not a GDS file.

Action: Use GDE to ensure that the files in the Global Directory are properly named. It is likely that something other than YottaDB or its utilities wrote to a database file or created a file with a name that coincides with one specified in the current Global Directory.

--------------
DBNOTMLTP
--------------

DBNOTMLTP, xxxx Block size not a multiple of 512 bytes

MUPIP Error: This is a MUPIP INTEG error. Refer to the topic `MUPIP INTEG Errors in the About This Manual section <https://docs.yottadb.com/MessageRecovery/about.html#mupip-integ-errors>`_.

Action: -

-----------------
DBNULCOL 
-----------------

DBNULCOL, NULL collation representation differs from the database file header settings

DSE/MUPIP/Run Time Error: This indicates the database contains a record with an empty subscript ("Null" subscript) representation that is incompatible with the current setting database file header setting for such a representation. The leading context (XXXX) specifies the block number and offset of the problematic record. This can only arise if someone changes the setting for the database while it contains one or more such subscripts. YottaDB recommends against making such a change. This message can originate from MUPIP INTEG, DSE INTEG or from running with VIEW "GDSCERT".

Action: Use the record and block information to remove the problematic record with DSE and restore the data appropriately, typically with a SET command. Note that the record and block of the record many change due to ongoing updates, so this operation requires great care and familiarity with DSE.

---------------
DBOPNERR
---------------

DBOPNERR, Error opening database file xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that a database operation tried to open the database file xxxx, which was inaccessible.

Action: Use GDE to ensure that the files in the Global Directory are properly named. Use the host shell command to ensure that the files exist and have proper security. Review the accompanying message(s) that indicate the reason for file-open failure.

-------------
DBPREMATEOF 
-------------

DBPREMATEOF, Premature end of file with database file xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that the size of the database file is less than the size of the minimum required database file header. The file may not be a valid YottaDB file.

Action: Investigate whether the file was properly created (with MUPIP) or inappropriately truncated. Also check whether the global directory points to a valid database.

--------------
DBPRIVERR 
--------------

DBPRIVERR, No privilege for attempted update operation for file: xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that the process did not have write access to database file xxxx.

Action: Disable application access to the function that resulted in the error or have the security manager grant write access to the appropriate user. Under some circumstances, security considerations may require moving some globals to other regions.

---------------
DBPTRMAP
---------------

Action: Report this database structure error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

----------------
DBPTRNOTPOS 
----------------

DBPTRNOTPOS, xxxx Block pointer negative

Run Time Warning: This indicates that xxxx block contains a record yyyy, which nests an invalid index pointer, and so failed block certification.

Action: Report this database structure error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

-----------------
DBQUELINK
-----------------

DBQUELINK, Database file xxxx, element location yyyy: blk = zzzz: control aaaa queue problem: was bbbb, expecting cccc

Run Time Error: This indicates that database cache recovery was triggered due to some abnormal event and the recovery routine detected damage to an internal YottaDB queue control structure in the database global buffer cache.

Action: The system automatically attempts to correct the problem. If this error continues to occur, attempt MUPIP RUNDOWN and if that fails too, restore database from backup and replay the journal files. Report the error to your YottaDB support channel if necessary.

--------------

DBVERPERFWARN1, Performance warning: Database aaaa is running in compatibility mode which degrades performance. Run MUPIP REORG UPGRADE for best overall performance.

Run Time Warning: This is a warning that the database is currently in compatibility (downgrade) mode. This mode causes all modified GDS blocks to be reformatted (to the downgraded database format) before they are flushed to the database file on disk. This is a very large performance hit.

Action: As the message indicates, run MUPIP REORG UPGRADE as soon as possible to move away from compatibility mode. This command can be run without taking the database offline. Once that completes successfully, the database is fully upgraded and there is no reformatting overhead anymore while flushing modified blocks to disk.

---------------
DBVERPERFWARN2
---------------

DBVERPERFWARN2, Peformance warning: Database aaaa is not fully upgraded. Run MUPIP REORG UPGRADE for best overall performance.

Run Time Warning: This is a performance warning message that indicates the database is not yet fully upgraded i.e. there are still blocks in the database file that need to be upgraded. Staying in this mode causes some inefficiencies which include (but are not limited to) reading blocks from disk.

Action: As the message indicates, run MUPIP REORG UPGRADE at the earliest. This command can be run without taking the database offline. Once that completes successfully, the database file is fully upgraded.

Compile Time Error: This indicates the argument for a SET * command attempted to assign a $ZWRTAC* pseudo-variable as a alias.

Action: Correct the code in question - the $ZWRTAC* is only useful in restoring context from ZSHOW or ZWRITE output and has very narrow capabilities.

---------------------
DZWRNOPAREN
---------------------

DZWRNOPAREN, $ZWRTACxxx is not allowed inside a parenthesized SET target

Compile Time Error: This indicates the argument for a SET command attempted to assign a $ZWRTAC* pseudo-variable within a parenthesized list of left-hand arguments.

Action: Correct the code in question - the $ZWRTAC* is only useful in restoring context from ZSHOW or ZWRITE output and has very narrow capabilities.

----------------------
ECLOSTMID 
----------------------

ECLOSTMID, $ECODE overflow, the first and last ecodes are retained, but some intervening ecodes have been lost

Run Time Warning: If the $ECODE exceeds the maximum string length, references to it return only the codes for the earliest and latest errors separated by the code for ECLOSTMID, which indicates that suppression of intervening error codes has occurred to accommodate string length restrictions.

Action: Consider whether it would be appropriate to introduce code to SET $ECODE= . This error is encountered either when the $ETRAP error handling is recursing (and probably defective), or while using $ZTRAP error handling that was coded prior to the introduction of $ECODE.

-------------------
ENCRYPTCONFLT
-------------------

ENCRYPTCONFLT, MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT and MUPIP EXTRACT -FORMAT=BIN cannot run concurrently - skipping oooo on region: rrrr, file: ffff

Action: Review the individual error messages for further information. The compilation may have produced code that is usable as long as the execution path does not encounter the error(s).

-----------------------
ERRWETRAP 
-----------------------

ERRWETRAP, Error while processing $ETRAP

Run Time Error: This indicates that $ETRAP contained invalid M code or caused a run time error.

Action: Check the $ETRAP variable. To get more information about the errors- SET $ZTRAP to empty string, and a temporary variable to the contents of $ETRAP. Then, SET $ETRAP to "BREAK" and XECUTE the temporary variable. It is best to keep the source code in $ETRAP simple if $ZTRAP is an empty string, since ETRAP specifies a string that YottaDB invokes upon encountering an exception condition.

-------------------
ERRWEXC 
-------------------

ERRWEXC, Error while processing exception string

Run Time Error: This indicates that an exception string contained invalid M code or caused a run-time error.

Action: Review the exception string and $ZTRAP. To get more information about the errors, SET a temporary variable to the contents of the exception string. Then, SET the exception string to "BREAK" and XECUTE the temporary variable.

------------------
ERRWIOEXC 
------------------

ERRWIOEXC, Error while processing I/O exception string

Run Time Error: This indicates that a device EXCEPTION string contained invalid M code or caused a run-time error.

Action: Review the exception string. To get more information about the errors, SET a temporary variable to the contents of the exception string and XECUTE the temporary variable. The EXCEPTION deviceparameter on an OPEN, USE, or CLOSE command defines an error handler for an I/O device.

------------------
ERRWZBRK
------------------

ERRWZBRK, Error while processing ZBREAK action string

Run Time Error: This indicates that a ZBREAK action contained invalid M code or caused a run-time error.

Action: Review the ZBREAK action string. To get more information about the errors, SET a temporary variable to the contents of the ZBREAK action string and XECUTE the variable. ZBREAK sets temporary break and trace points.

------------------
ERRWZINTR 
------------------

ERRWZINTR, Error while processing $ZINTERRUPT

Run Time Error: This indicates that a job interrupt had been signaled but that there was an error compiling the $ZINTERRUPT string. This message is sent to the operator log facility and if at the direct mode prompt or executing a direct mode command to the user console.

Action: Correct the $ZINTERRUPT to contain valid YottaDB commands.

-------------------
ERRWZTRAP 
-------------------

ERRWZTRAP, Error while processing $ZTRAP

Run Time Error: This indicates that $ZTRAP contained invalid M code or caused a run-time error.

Action: Verify the $ZTRAP variable. To get more information about the errors, SET a temporary variable to the contents of $ZTRAP. Then, SET $ZTRAP to "BREAK" and XECUTE the variable. Make sure the source code in $ZTRAP is simple because ZTRAP specifies a string that YottaDB invokes when it encounters an exception condition.

---------------------
EVENTLOGERR
---------------------

EVENTLOGERR, Error in event logging subsystem

Run Time Error: This indicates that the user is unable to access the event logging shared library or an event logging routine within the shared library.

Action: Review accompanying messages for additional information.

------------------
EXCLUDEREORG

MUPIP Error: This indicates that EXTRACT could not create the sequential output file because of an invalid format specified.

Action: Change the format to one of the three supported formats.

-----------------------
EXTRINTEGRITY
-----------------------

EXTRINTEGRITY, Database ffff potentially contains spanning nodes or data encrypted with two different keys

MUPIP Error: MUPIP EXTRACT cannot run because the database file ffff might contain spanning nodes or be partially encrypted with a particular key. Proceeding on a live database in such situation could result in data corruption.

Action: Reformat the data to contain no spanning nodes, let MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT complete (re)encryption of the database, or reissue the MUPIP EXTRACT command with a -FREEZE qualifier to acquire stand-alone access for the duration of the procedure. As a final resort, use an -OVERRIDE qualifier to proceed on a live database that either contains spanning nodes or is undergoing (re)encryption. YottaDB highly discourages using the -OVERRIDE qualifier unless the database is quiescent.

-------------------------
EXTSRCLIN
-------------------------

EXTSRCLIN, xxxx yyyy

Run Time Error: This indicates that there is an error in the external call table. The message indicates the line where YottaDB found the error.

Run Time Error: This error indicates that M code reached a label with a formallist by falling through from the previous label.

Action: Revisit your code to ensure that all invocations of labels with a formallist occur using a DO command or extrinsic function ($$).

--------------------
FCHARMAXARGS 
--------------------

FCHARMAXARGS, Argument count of $CHAR() function exceeded the maximum of 255

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a $CHAR() function specified an argument that was not in the range of 0 to 255. This error is also reported by services that attempt to format data using $CHAR() format.

Action: Look for large or negative $CHAR() arguments and ensure that all the arguments contain valid ASCII codes.

------------------
FCNSVNEXPECTED
------------------

FCNSVNEXPECTED, Function or special variable expected in this context

Compile Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB encountered a dollar sign in an expression that was not followed by a valid function or special variable name.

Action: Look for misspelled function and special variable names or a missing $ in an extrinsic.

--------------------
FILECREATE 
--------------------

FILECREATE, AAAA file xxxx created

MUPIP Information: This indicates that a file xxxx was created due to AAAA, where AAAA is lost transaction, broken transaction, or Journal Extract file.

Run Time/MUPIP Error: While creating a database file, some IO operation OOOO failed; this error is followed by the error that occurred.

Action: Addess the error and retry.

----------------
FILEDEL
----------------

FILEDEL, File xxxx successfully deleted

Run Time/MUPIP Information: This indicates that YottaDB or MUPIP has successfully deleted a file. This message is issued when a journal file in an inconsistent state found and deleted by the run-time system or MUPIP SET. This message is also issued by MUPIP JOURNAL RECOVER/ROLLBACK command when it deletes journal files that were created by a previously interrupted RECOVER/ROLLBACK command and are no longer necessary.

Action: -

---------------------
FILEDELFAIL
---------------------

FILEDELFAIL, Deletion of file xxxx failed

Run Time/MUPIP Warning: This indicates that YottaDB or MUPIP failed to remove the specified journal file xxxx.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information.

-------------------
FILEEXISTS 
-------------------

FILEEXISTS, File xxxx already exists

MUPIP Error: This indicates that MUPIP discovered a file with the filename xxxx already existing and did not overwrite it while executing the specified command(s).

Action: Rename the already existing file xxxx and reissue the MUPIP command(s), or modify the MUPIP command to name (explicitly/implicitly) a file different from xxxx.

---------------------
FILEIDGBLSEC 
---------------------

FILEIDGBLSEC, File ID in global section does not match with the database file

Run Time Error: When a YottaDB process attaches to a database and finds the corresponding shared memory structures initialized already, it performs integrity checks on the shared memory contents to ensure that they correspond back to the database file. When the shared memory copy of the database file ID does not match with the actual file ID of the database, this error is issued.

Action: Perform a MUPIP RUNDOWN on that region. If it fails with the same FILEIDGBLSEC error, then the shared memory contents are corrupt. Consult your YottaDB support channel before proceeding further.

-----------------------
FILEIDMATCH 
-----------------------

FILEIDMATCH, Saved File ID does not match the current ID - the file appears to have been moved

Run Time Error: This indicates that the journal file identified by a database in turn identifies itself as belonging to another database. Since a journal file must have a one-to-one relationship with a database, the process cannot do updates on this region until the problem is resolved.

Action: Create a new journal file, make a backup if appropriate and resume work.

-------------------------
FILENAMETOOLONG
-------------------------

FILENAMETOOLONG, File name too long

Run Time/MUPIP Information: This indicates that YottaDB or MUPIP has encountered a file name exceeding the maximum permissible length. 

Action: -

---------------------

---------------------

FILENOTCREATE, AAAA file xxxx not created

MUPIP Information: This indicates that the file xxxx was not created due to AAAA; where AAAA is lost transaction, or broken transaction, or Journal Extract file.

Action: Review accompanying messages for any further information. If there are no accompanying messages, it indicates that MUPIP did not find any lost or broken transactions for the corresponding extract file to be created.

------------------
FILENOTFND 
------------------

FILENOTFND, File xxxx not found

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB could not locate the specified source file xxxx.

Action: Look for a misspelling of the file-specification or improper preparation of the environment. If xxxx is a source file, it could have been moved or modified since the object in the image was compiled. Use ZLINK to make the object match the source.

--------------------
FILEOPENFAIL
--------------------

FILEOPENFAIL, Failed to open file ffff.

MUPIP Error: This message indicates that the MUPIP LOAD failed to open input file ffff.

Action: Please verify path and permission of input file ffff.

---------------------
FILEPARSE
---------------------

FILEPARSE, Error parsing file specification: xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates a problem with the specification of file xxxx, or the path to it. If the file is a source or object file, a ZLINK command or $ZROUTINES-related action encountered the error.

Action: Look for, and correct any typographical errors in the file-specification.

---------------------
FILERENAME 
---------------------

FILERENAME, File xxxx is renamed to yyyy

Run Time Information: This indicates that an existing file xxxx has been renamed to yyyy so that a new file created with the original name does not overwrite the existing one. YottaDB renames files during an automatic journal switch in case no explicit journal file name is specified, in which case the message is sent to the operator log. The utilities (MUPIP, GT.CM) rename files while opening log files or journal extract files and they send the message to the terminal. YottaDB or utilities rename files only if the new file name specified already exists.

Action: -

-----------------------
FILTERBADCONV 
-----------------------

FILTERBADCONV, Bad conversion of transaction xxxx by filter

Run Time Error: This error is logged to the replication server log file. This indicates that the output of the user-supplied external replication filter for the transaction with journal sequence number xxxx is incorrect.

Action: Fix the filter. Restart the replication server with the fixed filter.

----------------------
FILTERCOMM
----------------------

FILTERCOMM, Error communicating transaction xxxx with the filter

Run Time Error: This error is logged to the replication server log file. This indicates that the replication server encountered an error writing transaction with journal sequence number xxxx to the user supplied external filter's input. The accompanying system error message gives more details.

Action: Stop the filter and restart the replication server with the filter. Report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel.


--------------------
FILTERNOTALIVE
--------------------

FILTERNOTALIVE, Replication server detected that the filter is not alive while attempting to send transaction xxxx

Run Time Error: This error is logged to the replication server log file. This indicates that the replication server detected abnormal termination of the user supplied external filter while attempting to write transaction with journal sequence number xxxx to the filter's input.

Action: Determine the cause of the filter's abnormal termination. Fix the filter and restart the replication server with the fixed filter.

------------------
FILTERTIMEDOUT
------------------

FILTERTIMEDOUT, Replication server timed out attempting to read seqno ssss from external filter

MUPIP Error: This indicates that either a Source or Receiver Replication Server using an external filter took more than 30 sec to read a transaction with journal sequence number ssss from the user supplied external filter's output. The replication server reports this error in its log, stops the filter and terminates.

Action: Determine the cause for the filter's write delay. Fix the filter and restart the replication server with the fixed filter. If you cannot determine reason for delay, report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel.

------------------
FMLLSTMISSING
------------------

FMLLSTMISSING, The formal list is absent from a label called with an actual list: xxxx

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that a DO attempted to transfer control with an actuallist to a label xxxx that has no formallist.

Action: Look at the interface between the DO and the subroutine. Modify the actuallist, formallist, and/or label as appropriate.

-------------------
FMLLSTPRESENT
-------------------

FMLLSTPRESENT, The actual list is absent from a call to a label with a formal list: xxxx

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that a DO attempted to transfer control with no actuallist to a label xxxx that has a formallist.

Action: Look at the interface between the DO and the subroutine. Modify the actuallist, formallist, and/or label as appropriate.

------------------
FNARGINC 
------------------

FNARGINC, Format specifiers to $FNUMBER are incompatible: "xxxx"

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $FNUMBER function specified a format containing codes xxxx, which is incompatible code.

Action: Look for the character code "P" or "p" with any character other than the code ",".

----------------
FNNAMENEG
----------------

FNNAMENEG, Depth argument to $NAME cannot be negative

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB encountered a $NAME() reference with the optional integer expression that is set to a negative number.

Action: Modify the routine to ensure that $NAME() arguments are never negative.

-----------------
FNOTONSYS 
-----------------

FNOTONSYS, Function or special variable is not supported by this operating system

Compile Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB encountered a function or special variable it cannot process on the current operating system.

Action: Some functions are not appropriate to all operating environments. Contact your YottaDB support channel if you have questions about how to accomplish a particular task.

------------------
FNTRANSERROR
------------------

FNTRANSERROR, Buffer too small error occurred trying to translate filename FFFF

All YottaDB Components Error: While creating a database, resolving environment variables in a database path exceeded the maximum supported file name size.

Action: Reduce the path size by altering base components of the path or database name and/or the values of the environment variables to create a shorter overall filename and retry.

---------------------
FNUMARG 
---------------------

FNUMARG, $FNUMBER format specifier xxxx contains an illegal character: yyyy

Run Time Error: This indicates that an $FNUMBER function specified a format xxxx that contains invalid codes.

Action: Ensure that the format specifier in a $FNUMBER function is a sequence of the code characters "P", "p", "T", "t", "+", "-", and ",".

-------------------
FORCEDHALT 
-------------------

FORCEDHALT, Image HALTed by MUPIP STOP

Run Time Warning: This indicates that a YottaDB process recognized the receipt of a MUPIP STOP command and is terminating. This command stops YottaDB processes in an orderly fashion.

Action: Determine who initiated the MUPIP STOP and why they did so. Restart the process, if appropriate.

---------------------
FORCTRLINDX
---------------------

FORCTRLINDX, Using a FOR with an indexed control variable that's assigned values calculated in extrinsics is not currently safe

Compile Time/Run Time Error: YottaDB currently has trouble managing the interaction between a subscripted FOR control variable and expressions for its maintenance that have side effects that might change the array holding the control variable. Such elements include extrinsics ($$), external calls ($&) and $INCREMENT(). To avoid possible process context corruption, the compiler issues this error when it encounters the threatening circumstances. Note that the error can also appear at run-time without the accompanying indications of line and column if the construct appears in an XECUTE, the control variable is specified with indirection or the compiler warning is ignored.

Action: Chose an unsubscripted FOR control variable and / or evaluate the side-effect element(s) before setting up the FOR.

-------------------------
FOROFLOW
-------------------------

FOROFLOW, FOR commands nested too deeply

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a single line contained more than 32 FOR statements.

Action: Rework the routine so FORs are not so deeply nested in a single line.

--------------------------
FREEBLKSLOW
--------------------------

FREEBLKSLOW, Only bbbb free blocks left out of tttt total blocks for ffff

Run Time Warning: This message warns that database file ffff with automatic file extensions disabled has only bbbb blocks left out of a total allocation of tttt.

Action: Use MUPIP EXTEND to extend the file, or MUPIP SET to enable automatic extensions, or reduce the amount of data in the file.

-----------------------
FREEMEMORY
-----------------------

FREEMEMORY, Error occurred freeing memory

Run Time Error: Indicates an internal problem with storage management. The error is usually accompanied by a secondary message, which lists the reason towards the request failure.

Action: Report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel.

-------------------------
FREEZE 
-------------------------

FREEZE, Region: xxxx is already frozen

DSE/MUPIP Information: MUPIP FREEZE or DSE CHANGE commands generate this error if the region is already frozen.

Action: If the existing FREEZE is appropriate, no further action is necessary. If you decide to remove the prior FREEZE, issue a FREEZE command with the OFF qualifier.

--------------------
FREEZECTRL
--------------------

FREEZECTRL, Control Y or control C encountered during attempt to freeze the database. Aborting freeze.

MUPIP Information: This indicates that the user aborted the MUPIP FREEZE or MUPIP BACKUP/NOONLINE command; while the command was attempting to freeze the already frozen database.

Action: -

-----------------------
FREEZEERR 
-----------------------

FREEZEERR, Error while trying to ffff region rrrr

MUPIP Error: This indicates an unsuccessful database freeze or unfreeze (ffff) operation on region rrrr.

Action: Look for accompanying text that explains the cause of the error and take appropriate action.


-----------------------
FSEXP
-----------------------

FSEXP, File specification expected but not found

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ZROUTINES-related action did not specify a valid file-specification.

Action: Look for missing brackets.

--------------------
FSYNCTIMOUT
--------------------

FSYNCTIMOUT, Timed out on fsync for journal file xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that the process has been unable to get the journal flush lock on the journal file for nearly two minutes and has timed out. It is very likely that another process is holding the journal flush lock, wanting to do an fsync() on the journal file and has not released it so long, which would suggest an issue with disk subsystem response times.

Action: Check the disk subsystem for a software or hardware problem.

--------------------
FTOKERR 
--------------------

FTOKERR, Error getting ftok of the file xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB failed to take ftok of the database.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) to identify the cause of the failure.

-------------------
FTOKKEY
-------------------

FTOKKEY, FTOK key 0xnnnn

MUPIP Information: This message reports additional information for an associated error which had trouble with the FTOK key 0xnnnn.

Action: Check "ipcs -s" for the given key, and see the associated error.

-------------------
GBLEXPECTED 
-------------------

GBLEXPECTED, Global variable reference expected in this context

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This message indicates an attempt to apply a trigger definition to something other than a global variable.

Action: Review and correct the trigger definition.

--------------------
GBLMODFAIL 
--------------------

GBLMODFAIL, Global variable Conflict Test failed. Failure code: xxxx.

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ZQGBLMOD function encountered an integrity error while restoring from a failover. It is very likely that the database may have integrity errors or that the process-private data structures are corrupted.

Action: Report this error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

--------------------
GBLNAMCOLLRANGE 
--------------------

GBLNAMCOLLRANGE, Collation sequence #nnnn is out of range (0 thru 255)

GDE Error: This indicates that the collation sequence nnnn is out of the supported range of 0 thru 255.

Action: Specify a collation sequence number inside the supported range.

-----------------
GBLNAMCOLLUNDEF
-----------------

GBLNAMCOLLUNDEF, Error opening shared library of collation sequence #nnnn for GBLNAME gggg

GDE Error: This indicates that there was an error opening the shared library for collation sequence nnnn.

Action: Define the environment variable gtm_collate_<nnnn> to point to the shared library for collation sequence nnnn. Also ensure the path to the library is readable and the library is usable on that platform.

---------------
GBLNAMCOLLVER
---------------

GBLNAMCOLLVER, Global directory indicates GBLNAME gggg has collation sequence #nnnn with a version #vvvv but shared library reports different version #llll

GDE Error: This indicates that the shared library for collation sequence nnnn reported the version as vvvv when collation properties for global name gggg were first added by GDE into the global directory and that this invocation of GDE noticed the shared library reporting an incompatible version llll.

Action: See Action section for `COLLTYPVERSION error in the Message and Recovery Procedures Manual <https://docs.yottadb.com/MessageRecovery/errors.html#colltypversion>`_.

-----------------
GBLNAME
-----------------

GBLNAME, Either an identifier or a left parenthesis is expected after a ^ in this context

Compile Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB encountered a circumflex in a valid location for a global variable name; however, the circumflex was not followed by a variable name or a left parenthesis.

Action: Look for unwanted circumflexes in expressions. Ensure that global variable names are valid.

-------------------
GBLNAMEIS 
-------------------

GBLNAMEIS, in gblname gggg

GDE Information: This indicates the gblname where an out-of-range value was specified. This is usually a secondary message and is preceded by a VALTOOSMALL or VALTOOBIG error.

Action: Fixing the preceding error would automatically address this accompanying informational message.

-------------------
GBLNOEXIST 
-------------------

GBLNOEXIST, Global xxxx no longer exists

MUPIP Information: The specified global variable does not exist in the database. This indicates that the global variable xxxx was present when MUPIP reorg started, but was killed when reorg was working on it.

Action: -

-----------------
GBLNOMAPTOREG
-----------------

GBLNOMAPTOREG, Global gggg does not map to region rrrr in current global directory

Run Time Error: Run Time Error: This indicates that a VIEW "YDIRTREE" or $VIEW("YDIRTREE") was done with global gggg and region rrrr as parameters but the global does not map to that region in the current global directory.

Action: VIEW "YDIRTREE" or $VIEW("YDIRTREE") is an undocumented feature and so should NOT be used directly. $$get^%GBLDEF is the only tool that uses this but internally catches the GBLNOMAPTOREG error. This means the GBLNOMAPTOREG error message will never be visible to the end-user.

------------------
GBLOFLOW
------------------

GBLOFLOW, Database segment is full

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that an error was encountered while extending the database file.

Action: Examine the accompanying message(s) for the cause of the error. If the error is due to insufficient authorization, address that. If the error is due to TOTALBLKMAX (refer to the explaination of that message) or a lack of enough free space on the disk to fit the size of a database file, try performing a KILL of some nodes in the database to get free blocks in the existing allocated space (you may need to KILL several subscripted nodes before you can KILL a name node).

---------------
GBLSECNOTGDS 
---------------

GBLSECNOTGDS, Global section xxxx is not a YottaDB global section

Run Time Error: This indicates that when attempting to startup a database file, YottaDB encountered an existing global section whose contents it did not recognize.

Action: Investigate whether you have a global section name conflict between YottaDB and some other application. YottaDB uses GT$ as a prefix for all global section names that it creates. Make sure no other application in the system is using the same naming convention; it is very likely the global section contents are damaged. If necessary, report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel.

--------------
GDCREATE 
--------------

GDCREATE, Creating global directory File xxxx

GDE Information: This indicates that an EXIT command caused GDE to write a new Global Directory into file xxxx.

Action: N/A

---------------
GDEASYNCIONOMM 
---------------

GDEASYNCIONOMM, ssss segment has ASYNCIO turned on. Cannot support MM access method

GDE Error: This indicates that segement ssss has enabled ASYNCIO, which is not compatible with the MM access method.

Action: For MM do not use ASYNCIO; in order to choose ASYNCIO, use the BG access method. 

-------------
GDECHECK 
-------------

GDECHECK, Internal GDE consistency check

GDE Fatal: This indicates that an internal consistency check failed.

Action: Look in the user's current working directory for a GDEDUMP.DMP context file that your YottaDB support channel can examine to help determine the cause of the error. If necessary, report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel.

--------------
GDECRYPTNOMM
--------------

GDECRYPTNOMM, ssss segment has encryption turned on. Cannot support MM access method

GDE Error: This error is triggered by an attempt to mark an MM database segment ssss as encrypted with GDE. The MM access method is not supported for encrypted databases.

Action: Use the BG access method for encrypted files.

---------------
GDINVALID
---------------

GDINVALID, Unrecognized Global Directory file format: ffff, expected label: eeee, found: bbbb

Run Time Error: This indicates that a version of the global directory file ffff does not match with the version expected by YottaDB. The file might have been created by an incompatible YottaDB version. If the text of eeee or bbbb contain non-graphic characters, YottaDB replaces each of them with a period (.).

Action: Compare the labels eeee and bbbb. If the global directory was created by an earlier YottaDB version, upgrade the file by loading and then saving the file using the GDE of the new YottaDB version.

------------------
GDNOTSET
------------------

GDNOTSET, Global Directory not changed because the current GD cannot be written

GDE Information: This indicates that GDE could not complete a SETGD command because it could not verify the current Global Directory. This prevented a write of the current information.

Action: Either modify the current Global Directory or abandon it by adding the QUIT qualifier to the SETGD command.

------------------
GDREADERR 
------------------

GDREADERR, Error reading Global Directory: xxxx

GDE Information: This indicates that GDE encountered an error when it attempted to read the existing Global Directory in file xxxx.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information.


---------------
GDUNKNFMT
---------------

GDUNKNFMT, xxxx is not formatted as a global directory

GDE Information: This indicates that GDE could not load the specified file xxxx because it is not a valid Global Directory file. GDE aborts the load after it issues this message.

Action: Verify that the file is valid and look for typographical errors. Something other than YottaDB or its utilities may have written to the Global Directory file or created a file with a name that coincides with the one specified by GTM$GBLDIR / gtmgbldir.

--------------
GDUPDATE 
--------------

GDUPDATE, Updating Global Directory File xxxx

GDE Information: This indicates that an EXIT or SETGD command caused GDE to write a new version of the existing Global Directory in file xxxx.

Action: -


--------------
GDUSEDEFS 
--------------

Run Time Error: The database file (dddd) has already been opened by a host (nnnn) other than the local host (hhhh).

Action: Ensure that host nnnn has closed dddd. Make sure both host names are correct. Changing host names in the middle of a database access can cause this error.

------------------
HTEXPFAIL 
------------------

HTEXPFAIL, Hash table expansion failed for lack of memory

Run Time/MUPIP Error: The hash table, an internally expanding data structure maintained by YottaDB, has exceeded its maximum capacity. In YottaDB, each unique local variable name uses up some hash table space. In MUPIP, it is backward recovery (or rollback) that might encounter this error. Here each TP transaction that is encountered in the backward processing phase of recovery uses up some hash table space. In either case, it is more likely that a process will run out of virtual memory much before it reaches the maximum hashtable capacity.

Action: Increase process memory quotas to increase available process virtual memory. Reduce the number of unique local variable names referenced by the YottaDB process. For MUPIP backward recovery/rollback, reduce the number of TP transactions encountered in the backward processing phase by using a later timestamp in the SINCE_TIME qualifier or higher RESYNC_SEQNO for rollback.

-------------------
HTOFLOW
-------------------

HTOFLOW, Hash table overflow, local or region name space exceeded

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that the hash table contains too many local names or region names.

Action: Reduce the number of local and region name entries in the table.

-------------
HTSHRINKFAIL
-------------

HTSHRINKFAIL, Hash table compaction failed to allocate new smaller table due to lack of memory

Run Time Error: YottaDB found an internal hash table over-allocated but was unable to reduce its size because the process memory was too large to allocate a new smaller table; YottaDB must allocated the new table before it can release the old table because it must copy the contents out of the "too-large" table into the smaller one. After this warning, the process continues running with the larger table.

Action: Investigate whether the process size can be reduced, or the available memory increased.

------------------
ICUERROR
------------------

ICUERROR, ICU returned status ssss which is either unrecognized or inconsistent with the operating context

Run Time Error: The open-source ICU module which YottaDB uses for some Unicode processing return an error code ssss that YottaDB did not recognize as valid for the current context.

-------------------
IFNOTINIT 
-------------------

IFNOTINIT, External Interface must first call GTM$INIT or M routine

Run Time Error: This indicates that an external routine could not access a YottaDB database library routine because it did not call the GTM$INIT library routine first. The GTM$INIT library routine initializes the YottaDB run-time environment.

Action: Call GTM$INIT or a YottaDB M routine before calling any other database access library routine.

-------------------
IGNBMPMRKFREE 
-------------------

IGNBMPMRKFREE, Ignoring bitmap free-up operation for region rrrr (dddd) due to concurrent ONLINE ROLLBACK

Run Time Information: A multi-node KILL bit map cleanup operation detected a concurrent online rollback in region rrrr mapped to database file dddd, and abandoned the cleanup, possibly leaving incorrectly marked busy errors.

Action: If there are incorrectly marked busy errors, match them with this cause and clean them up using DSE.

ILLCHAR, xxxx is not a legal character in this context

GDE Information: This indicates that GDE encountered the invalid character xxxx in its command input stream. This character should never appear in the context in which it was found.

Action: Review and re-enter a valid command sequence.

------------------
ILLESOCKBFSIZE 
------------------

ILLESOCKBFSIZE, The specified socket buffer size is xxxx, which is either 0 or too big

Run Time Error: This indicates that the OPEN command specified an inappropriate buffer size.

Action: Revise the command.

-----------------
IMAGENAME 
-----------------

IMAGENAME, The executing module name should be xxxx instead of yyyy

Run Time Error: This indicates that the executable invoked should have been named xxxx instead of its current name yyyy.

Action: Revisit the YottaDB installation.

------------------
INDEXTRACHARS
------------------

INDEXTRACHARS, Indirection string contains extra trailing characters

Compile Time Error: This indicates that an indirection string ends with a syntactically incorrect sequence.

Action: Look for extra trailing characters in the indirection string.

------------------
INDMAXNEST 
------------------

INDMAXNEST, Maximum nesting of indirection expressions exceeded

Run Time Error: This indicates that indirection nesting required more space than YottaDB provides. The space needed by YottaDB is a function of the number, type and complexity of the indirect expressions being nested.

Action: Review the program logic and reduce the amount of nested indirection in the routine.

-------------------
INDRCOMPFAIL 
-------------------

INDRCOMPFAIL, Compilation of indirection failed

Run Time Error: This indicates that an indirection or XECUTE command failed due to syntax errors.

Action: Review the the code and make sure the indirection or XECUTE string has valid syntax and contains no non-graphic characters. Consider using $ZWRITE to identify any such characters.

--------------------
INDRMAXLEN 
--------------------

INDRMAXLEN, Maximum length xxxxx of an indirection argument was exceeded

Run Time Error: This indicates that an indirection or XECUTE used a value that exceeded the maximum length for a source code element.

Action: Review the the code to shorten the length of the XECUTE or indirection string.

--------------------
INITORRESUME 
--------------------

INITORRESUME, UPDATERESYNC on a Supplementary Instance must additionally specify INITIALIZE or RESUME

Receiver Server log/MUPIP Error: Issued by a Receiver Server when started with -UPDATERESYNC on a Supplementary Instance which allows local updates, but started without specifying either -INITIALIZE or -RESUME.

Action: Additionally specify -INITIALIZE if this is the first time this supplementary instance is connecting to the source side OR if the receiver side databases have been refreshed from a backup of the source side. If on the other hand, the receiving instance had already been replicating from the source before and only had its instance file recreated in between, -RESUME might be appropriate with the -UPDATERESYNC. Check -RESUME documentation for more details.


-------------------
INPINTEG 
-------------------

INPINTEG, Input integrity error -- aborting load

GDE Fatal: This indicates that GDE is aborting the session because integrity errors prevented it from loading the specified Global Directory. GDE usually displays this message with other error messages. GDE aborts the load after issuing this message.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information. Verify whether the command specified the intended file. Something other than YottaDB and its utilities probably wrote to a Global Directory file or created a file with a name identical to the one specified by GTM$GBLDIR / gtmgbldir.

-------------------
INSNOTJOINED 
-------------------

INSNOTJOINED, Replicating Instance RRRR is not a member of the same Group as Instance IIII

Receiver Server log/MUPIP Error: A Receiver Server or a MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -FETCHRESYNC on instance RRRR produces this error when it attempts to establish a replication connection with an instance that belongs to a different replication configuration or Group. MUPIP performs this safety check at the time it establishes a replication connection between two instances.

Action: Use the Remote IP Address in the Receiver / Source Server log files or the primary instance name field from MUPIP REPLICATE -JNLPOOL -SHOW command to identify the Source Server that may have inadvertently attempted to establish a replication connection with your Source Server. Shut down the Source Server if the Source Server does not belong to your replication configuration. If you are attempting to move a Source Server from a different Group, reinitialize the Source Server. Note that only supplementary instances started with -UPDOK can accept updates from a different Group.

--------------------
INSROLECHANGE 
--------------------

INSROLECHANGE, Supplementary Instance SSSS and non-Supplementary Instance IIII belong to the same Group

Receiver Server log/MUPIP Error: Issued by a Receiver Server or a MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -FETCHRESYNC on Supplementary Instance SSSS attempted to connect to non-Supplementary Instance IIII, but found they have the same Group identification. Because supplementary and non-Supplementary Instances cannot belong to the same Group, one of these instances must have changed roles without appropriate re-initialization.

Action: Either reinitialize the instance that is changing roles or revert the inappropriate role change.

-------------------
INSTFRZDEFER
-------------------

INSTFRZDEFER, Instance Freeze initiated by eeee error on region rrrrr deferred due to critical resource conflict.

Run Time Information: eeee error encountered on region rrrrr triggered the Instance Freeze mechanism in an attempt to set the freeze, but couldn't do complete the freeze due to a critical resource conflict. Any process subsequently attempting an update will reattempt the freeze later until one succeeds or the error subsides.

Action: None necessary.

-----------------------
INSUNKNOWN 
-----------------------

INSUNKNOWN, Supplementary Instance SSSS has no instance definition for non-Supplementary Instance IIII

Receiver Server log/MUPIP Error: Issued by a Receiver Server or a MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -FETCHRESYNC on Supplementary Instance SSSS, started with -UPDOK, attempted to connect to non-Supplementary Instance IIII, but found it has no matching instance information.

Action: Take a backup of the database and replication instance file from a current instance on the non-Supplementary Group, load the backup data on the Supplementary Instance and start the Receiver Server on the supplementary instance using -UPDATERESYNC=<instbak.repl> where instbak.repl is the backup of the replication instance file taken along with the database backup.

------------------------
INTEGERRS
------------------------

INTEGERRS, Database integrity errors

MUPIP Error: This indicates that INTEG encountered one or more errors in the database file.

Action: Review the accompanying errors for more information, and report this database error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

-------------------
INVACCMETHOD 
-------------------

INVACCMETHOD, Invalid access method

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the user specified an invalid access method in a MUPIP SET command.

Action: This command can only use Memory Map (MM) or Buffered Globals (BG) access methods.

------------------
INVADDRSPEC 
------------------

INVADDRSPEC, Invalid IP address specification

Run Time Error: This indicates the IP address and/or port specified is not in a valid format.

Action: Verify and correct the IP address and port.

-----------------
INVALIDRIP 
-----------------

INVALIDRIP, Invalid read-in-progress field in Cache Record. Resetting and continuing. Region: xxxx.

Run Time Error: This indicates that the read-in-progress field corresponding to a particular global buffer had an invalid value. The read-in-progress field usually indicates whether this global buffer is currently being read into from disk or not, and hence takes on two values only. Whenever the field takes on any value outside of these two, YottaDB detects the situation and corrects it in addition to logging this incident in the operator log.

Action: Report the operator log message with any other relevant information to your YottaDB support channel.

--------------------
INVBITLEN
--------------------

INVBITLEN, Invalid size of the bit string

Run Time Error: This indicates that an attempt was made to create a bit string of size less than 1 or more than 253,952 bits.

Action: Modify the code so it adheres to the permitted range.

---------------------
INVBITPOS 
---------------------

INVBITPOS, Invalid position in the bit string

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB encountered a bit position argument to a $ZBITGET or $ZBITSET function that exceeded the length of the bit string, or was less than one (1).

Action: Use $ZBITLEN() to modify the code so the bit reference falls within the allocated length of the bit string.

-------------------
INVBITSTR 
-------------------

INVBITSTR, Invalid bit string

Run Time Error: This indicates that an attempt was made to use a bit string with a leading character that was not within the permitted range of values.

Action: Determine the source for the first character of the bit string and modify the method of its creation to limit possible values to the valid range of 0 to 7.

-------------------
INVCMD
-------------------

INVCMD, Invalid command keyword encountered

Compile Time Warning: This indicates that the program attempted to use an invalid keyword where a command was expected.

Action: Look for typographical errors or improper command abbreviations.

-----------------
INVCTLMNE
-----------------

INVCTLMNE, Invalid control mnemonics

Run Time Error: The current device does not support the specified controlmnemonic.

Action: Check the spelling of the controlmnemonic, and be sure the mnemonicspace (if any) for the current device supports the requested usage of the controlmnemonic.

------------------
INVDLRCVAL 
------------------

INVDLRCVAL, Invalid $CHAR() value.

Run Time Error: The $CHAR() function triggers this error if its arguments contains an invalid code-point. According to the Unicode Standard version 5.0, invalid code-points include the following sets:

- The "too big" code-points (those greater than the maximum U+10FFFF).

- The "surrogate" code-points (in the range [U+D800, U+DFFF]) which are reserved for UTF-16 encoding.

- The "non-character" code-points that are always guaranteed to be not assigned to any valid characters. This set consists of [U+FDD0, U+FDEF] and all U+nFFFE and U+nFFFF (for each n from 0x0 to 0x10).

Action: Specify argument in the range of valid Unicode code-points.


----------------------
INVECODEVAL
----------------------

INVECODEVAL, Invalid value for $ECODE (xxxx).

Run Time Error: This indicates that an attempt was made to assign $ECODE an invalid value. Such an action modifies $ECODE to have a valid value indicating this error, which triggers an error trap.

Action: Revise the SET $ECODE value complies with the required specification of the error codes of the format ,Mnnn,Zxxx,Uxxx,. The error codes in the form of ,Mnnn,, ,Zxxx, and ,Uxxx, represent ANSI standard codes, implementation-specific codes and end-user defined codes respectively.

-------------------------
INVERRORLIM 
-------------------------

INVERRORLIM, Invalid ERROR_LIMIT qualifier value. Must be at least zero

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the value assigned to the ERROR_LIMIT qualifier is negative (less than zero).

Action: Assign a value greater than zero (0) for ERROR_LIMIT qualifier.

------------------------
INVFCN
------------------------

INVFCN, Invalid function name

Compile Time Error: This indicates that an expression contained a string of the form "$name(...)", but "name" was not a valid function name.

Action: Look for typographical errors, improper function name abbreviation, or a missing $ in an extrinsic.

-------------------
INVGBLDIR 
-------------------

INVGBLDIR, Invalid Global Directory spec: xxxx. Continuing with yyyy.

GDE Information: This indicates that the Global Directory xxxx specified by GTM$GBLDIR / gtmgbldir or by SETGD and the qualifier FILE= is not a valid file-specification.

Action: When this error occurs, GDE uses the default specification of the current process default directory. Continue with the default and rename the result after leaving GDE, or change the specification with a SETGD command and the FILE= qualifier.

-------------------
INVGLOBALQUAL
-------------------

INVGLOBALQUAL, Error in GLOBAL qualifier : Parse error at offset xxxx in yyyy

MUPIP Error: This indicates a syntax error in GLOBAL qualifier value yyyy at offset xxxx.

Action: Specify correct value for GLOBAL.

--------------------
INVGTMEXIT 
--------------------

INVGTMEXIT, Inappropriate invocation of gtm_exit. gtm_exit cannot be invoked from external calls.

Call in/Run Time Error: This indicates that the call-in shut-down function gtm_exit() has been called from an external call C function. Since the YottaDB run-time system must be operational even after the external call function returns, gtm_exit() is meant to be called only once during a process lifetime, and only from the base C/C++ program when YottaDB functions are no longer required by the program.

Action: Remove all invocations of gtm_exit() from external call functions.

-------------------
INVICUVER 
-------------------

INVICUVER, xxx not found in the ICU libraries. ICU version 3.6.x must be used.

Run Time Error: YottaDB triggers this error when it encounters an incompatible ICU version.

Action: Install ICU version 3.6.x. 


--------------------
INVIDQUAL 
--------------------

INVIDQUAL, Invalid ID qualifier value xxxx

MUPIP Error: This indicates that an invalid value xxxx was assigned to the ID qualifier.

Action: Assign a valid value for ID qualifier.

-------------------
INVINTMSG 
-------------------

INVINTMSG, Invalid interrupt message received

GT.CM Error: An invalid interrupt request was received. This may indicate a network problem.

Action: Check the DECnet error logs and other network components.


-------------------
INVLINKTMPDIR
-------------------

INVLINKTMPDIR, Value for $gtm_linktmpdir is either not found or not a directory: dddd

Run Time Error: Indicates the process cannot access directory dddd, which it needs in order to do auto-relink as specified by its $ZROUTINES; the directory may not exist as a directory or the process lacks authorization to the directory.

Action: The directory specification comes from $gtm_linktmpdir if it is defined, otherwise from $gtm_tmp if that is defined; otherwise it defaults to the system temporary directory, typically /tmp. Either correct the environment variable definition or ensure directory dddd is appropriately set up. Note that all users of auto-relink for a directory normally need to use the same temporary directory for their relink control files.


------------------------
INVLOCALE 
------------------------

INVLOCALE, Attempt to reset locale to supplied value of $gtm_locale xxxx failed

All YottaDB Components Error: YottaDB found the value of $gtm_locale xxxx did not specify a valid currently supported local

Action: Correct the locale setup and restart the process.

---------------------
INVMEMRESRV 
---------------------

INVMEMRESRV, Could not allocate YottaDB memory reserve (xxxx)

Images Warning: YottaDB could not allocate xxxx KiB of reserve memory for handling and reporting out-of-memory conditions. Examine the subsequent messages for more information on why the memory reserve allocation failed.

Action: If $gtm_memory_reserve is too high, specify a lower value and retry. If the value is reasonable, determine what else is preventing the allocation (process or system limits or usage by other system components). Note that YottaDB uses this reserve only when a process runs out of memory so it mostly requires address space and almost never requires actual memory.


-------------------
INVMNEMCSPC 
-------------------

INVMNEMCSPC, Unsupported mnemonicspace xxxx

Run Time Error: The mnemonicspace xxxx specified in an OPEN command is not supported by YottaDB.

Action: Replace the mnemonicspace with a supported one.

--------------------
INVMVXSZ
--------------------

INVMVXSZ, Invalid block size for GOQ load format

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the LOAD command with the qualifier FORMAT=GOQ determined that the input file did not have the proper block size for that format.

Action: Determine how the file was created and use the proper specification for the FORMAT= qualifier.


-----------------------
INVNETFILNM 
-----------------------

INVNETFILNM, Invalid file name following node designation in global directory

GT.CM Error: This indicates that the GT.CM Server received a node name that does not exist on the network.

Action: Use GDE to check the Global Directory on the originating node for typographical errors in a remote node file-specification.


-----------------------
INVOBJ 
-----------------------

INVOBJ, Cannot ZLINK object file due to unexpected format

Run Time Error: This indicates that ZLINK encountered invalid records in the object file it was trying to integrate into the image.

Action: Determine whether ZLINK has the intended argument. If the object file has been damaged, recreate it with a ZLINK that specifies the source file using an .M extension.


-------------------
INVOBJFILE 
-------------------

INVOBJFILE, Cannot ZLINK object file ffff due to unexpected format

Run Time Error: This indicates that ZLINK encountered invalid records in the object file ffff it was trying to integrate into the image.

Action: Determine whether ZLINK has the intended argument. If the object file has been damaged, recreate it with a ZLINK that specifies the source file using an .M extension, a ZCOMPILE or a mumps command at the shell.


----------------------
INVPORTSPEC 
----------------------

INVPORTSPEC, Invalid port specification

Run Time Error: This indicates that the OPEN command socket parameter contained an invalid port number.

Action: Redefine the socket parameter to a value between 0 and 65535.


-----------------------
INVPROT 
-----------------------

INVPROT, Invalid protocol specified by remote partner

GT.CM Error: This indicates that the remote networked system used a protocol incompatible with the locally installed version of GT.CM.

Action: Verify that both systems have compatible versions of GT.CM installed.

------------------
INVQUALTIME 
------------------

INVQUALTIME, Invalid time qualifier value. Specify as xxxx=delta_or_absolute_time.

MUPIP Error: This indicates that time qualifier value specified for xxxx is invalid.

Action: Reissue the command with correct syntax.


---------------------
INVREDIRQUAL 
---------------------

INVREDIRQUAL, Invalid REDIRECT qualifier value. xxxx

MUPIP Error: This indicates a syntax error in REDIRECT qualifier value.

Action: Reissue the command with correct syntax for REDIRECT.

-----------------
INVROLLBKLVL 
-----------------

INVROLLBKLVL, Rollback level (xxxx) not less than the current $tlevel (yyyy). Cannot rollback.

Run Time Error: This indicates that the application is attempting to ROLLBACK to a transaction level that is zero (0) or negative. The minimum transaction level that an application can be rolled back to is one (1).

Action: Review the logic and code path that led to the error and modify the code appropriately.


---------------------
INVSPECREC 
---------------------

INVSPECREC, Invalid global modifier record

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB could not access the header information for a global; therefore, it could not determine the collation characteristics of the global.

Action: Use the %gbldef utility routine to investigate the current state of the global header and correct it.


--------------------
INVSTACODE 
--------------------

INVSTACODE, Invalid value for second parameter of $STACK (xxxx).

Run Time Error: This indicates that the intrinsic function $STACK received an unrecognized string xxxx for the info (second) parameter.

Action: Make sure the second argument is "MCODE", "ECODE" or "PLACE".


---------------------
INVSTATSDB 
---------------------

INVSTATSDB, Database file SSSS associated with statistics database region RRRR is not a valid statistics database

Run Time Error: Indicates the file SSSS designated as a statistics database is either not a valid database at all, or is not a statistics database.

Action: Rename (if it might be a valid database) or delete (if its origin is unknown) the file in question as appropriate and retry.

--------------------
INVSTRLEN 
--------------------

INVSTRLEN, Invalid string length xxxx: max yyyy

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB encountered a string with a length of xxxx that exceeds the maximum acceptable length yyyy in this context.

Action: Modify the string to an acceptable length.

-------------------
INVSVN 
-------------------

INVSVN, Invalid special variable name

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a variable of the form "$name" did not match any valid special variable name.

Action: Look for typographical errors, an improper special variable name abbreviation, or a missing $ in an extrinsic.


-------------------
INVTMPDIR
-------------------

INVTMPDIR, Value for $gtm_tmpdir is either not found or not a directory: dddd - Reverting to default value

Error: Indicates the process cannot access directory dddd, which it may need for a number of actions; the directory may not exist as a directory or the process lacks authorization to locate the directory.

Action: The directory specification comes from $gtm_tmp if it is defined, otherwise it defaults to the system temporary directory, typically /var/tmp on Solaris and /tmp in other environments. Either correct the environment variable definition or ensure directory dddd is appropriately set up. Note that all users of a particular YottaDB instance normally need to use the same temporary directory to ensure proper interprocess communication.

------------------
INVTRCGRP 
------------------

INVTRCGRP, Invalid trace group specified in $gtm_trace_groups: gggg

Run Time Error: The process startup environment attempted to activate a diagnostic tracing facility but specified a group name of gggg and there is currently no such group.

Action: Check with your YottaDB support channel for the currently available group names.


-------------------
INVTRNSQUAL
-------------------

INVTRNSQUAL, Invalid TRANSACTION qualifier. Specify only one of TRANSACTION=[NO]SET or TRANSACTION=[NO]KILL.

MUPIP Error: This indicates that an invalid value was assigned to the -TRANSACTION qualifier.

Action: Specify appropriate value to the -TRANSACTION qualifier.


--------------------
INVZBREAK 
--------------------

INVZBREAK, Cannot set ZBREAK in direct mode routine (GTM$DMOD)

Run Time Error: GTM$DMOD is an embedded routine that provides direct mode and it does not permit insertion of a ZBREAK.

Action: Issue ZBREAK only for application code


--------------------
INVZDIRFORM 
--------------------

INVZDIRFORM, Illegal value (xxxx) specified for ZDIR_FORM

Run Time Error: This indicates that the value specified for ZDIR_FORM in the VIEW command is not recognized by YottaDB.

Action: Specify a valid value for ZDIR_FORM.


-------------------
INVZROENT 
-------------------

INVZROENT, xxxx is neither a directory nor an object library(DLL)

Run Time Error: This indicates that an invalid entry (xxxx), neither an object directory, nor a shared library, has been specified in $ZROUTINES.

Action: Remove xxxx or replace it with a valid directory or a shared library.


--------------------
INVZSTEP
--------------------

INVZSTEP, Invalid ZSTEP qualifier

Run Time Error: This indicates that ZSTEP had an argument other than OVER, INTO, or OUTOF.

Action: ZSTEP only accepts these three keyword arguments. It does not accept variables or indirection. Use one of the valid arguments. If you need additional control, consider using ZBREAK.


----------------------
INVZWRITECHAR 
----------------------

INVZWRITECHAR, Invalid characters for a ZWRITE format

Run Time/Compile Time Error: When transforming an expression from ZWRITE format to full text format with $ZWRITE(expr,1), the expression must be in a format that YottaDB would have produced when transforming a text string to ZWRITE format.

Action: Examine the expression and ensure that it is in proper ZWRITE format


--------------------
IOEOF 
--------------------

IOEOF, Attempt to read past an end-of-file

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that a READ command for a run-time system or a MUPIP command attempted to move past an end-of-file.

Action: Verify that the $ZEOF special variable is tested by the function betwee READs or that an EXCEPTION code string is assigned to handle EOFs. Alternatively, have your $ETRAP (or $ZTRAP) error handling deal with this error. The USE command has a REWIND deviceparameter that allows you to read from the beginning of the file without having to CLOSE and OPEN again, which may facilitate recovery from this error. Attempting to READ from a non-existent file not opened READONLY also causes this error. In the event of a MUPIP error, make sure the file being read is not corrupted.

----------------
IOERROR 
----------------

IOERROR, Error occurred while doing aaaa in oooo operation -- called from module mmmm at line LLLL

Run Time Error: On UNIX this indicates a system call used to manage the underlying O/S device for a FIFO, PIPE or Sequential Disk failed in a way that YottaDB did not anticipate.

Action: Use the OS documentation to investigate the failure.


-----------------
IONOTOPEN 
-----------------

IONOTOPEN, Attempt to USE an I/O device which has not been opened

Run Time Error: This indicates that a USE command attempted to make the current device one that had not been OPENed. The current device remains unchanged when this error occurs.

Action: Look for a missing OPEN or an extra CLOSE command.


-------------------
IORUNDOWN 
-------------------

IORUNDOWN, Error during image rundown

Run Time Error: This indicates that as part of image termination, the process attempted to deallocate all devices and files allocated in YottaDB but encountered an error.

Action: Use the appropriate host shell commands to display the statuses of the devices being used by the process, and deallocate any device that is still allocated.

----------------------
IOWRITERR
----------------------

IOWRITERR, IO write by PID xxxx to block yyyy of database zzzz failed. PID aaaa retrying the IO.

Run Time Error: This error message is sent to operator log when a queued write fails and is about to be retried. If an error status is available, it follows this message.

Action: Appearance of this message usually indicates disk subsystem error condition. Check disk error logs, in addition to operator logs for accompanying messages.


---------------------
IPADDRREQ
---------------------

IPADDRREQ, Active connection requires IP address

Run Time Error: This indicates that an OPEN command specified a TCP mnemonicspace; however, it did not have a socket for an active connection or a LISTEN deviceparameter to designate a passive connection.

Action: Determine the type of connection desired and add a SOCKET=socket-id and/or a LISTEN deviceparameter.


-----------------------
IPCNOTDEL 
-----------------------

IPCNOTDEL, xxxx : yyyy did not delete IPC resources for region zzzz

MUPIP Information: This indicates that MUPIP did not delete the shared system resources of the region. The shared system resources may still be being in use by some other processes.

Action: Find out if some other process was attached to the shared system resource. If appropriate, issue MUPIP RUNDOWN REG * to remove the shared resource.


-----------------------
ISOLATIONSTSCHN 
-----------------------

ISOLATIONSTSCHN, Error changing NOISOLATION status for global xxxx within a TP transaction from aaaa to bbbb

Run Time Error: In YottaDB, the VIEW "NOISOLATION" command changes the isolation-status of the global variable(s) specified. If a process attempts to change the global variable's isolation-status within a TP transaction after it has referenced the global variable in the same TP transaction, the ISOLATIONSTSCHN error gets triggered.

Action: Change the application to issue the VIEW "NOISOLATION" command in conformance with the allowed usage.

-------------------
ISSPANGBL 
-------------------

ISSPANGBL, Operation cannot be performed on global ^gggg as it spans multiple regions in current global directory

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ $ set^%GBLDEF or $ $ kill^%GBLDEF was attempted on a global that spans multiple regions.

Action: Only $$get^%GBLDEF is supported for spanning globals. Specify a non-spanning global or change the set/kill to a get. For spanning globals, use the GDE ADD -GBLNAME command to set collation characteristics.


---------------------
JIUNHNDINT 
---------------------

JIUNHNDINT, An error during $ZINTERRUPT processing was not handled: eeee;

Run Time Error: When returning from code invoked by MUPIP INTRPT (clearing $ZININTERRPT), YottaDB implicitly clears any error(s) detected while 1=$ZININTERRUPT, sends this error notification to the operator log and continues processing; eeee is the mnemonic for the unhandled error.

Action: Fix $ZINTERRUPT handler to either not generate the error or to correctly handle it before returning to interrupted code

-----------------
JNI 
-----------------

JNI, xxxx

Run Time Error: YottaDB uses this message with appropriate accompanying text, xxxx, to indicate an error condition with a Java call-out invocation.

Action: Examine the text and address the described error condition.


------------------
JNLACCESS
------------------

JNLACCESS, Error accessing journal file xxxx

Run Time Error: YottaDB sends this message to the system log followed by other messages detailing the failure. xxxx is the file-specification for the inaccessible journal. In most situations, this error occurs when the journal file storage runs out of disk space or there are permission issues.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information. This usually means an error while trying to write to the journal file.

------------------
JNLACTINCMPLT 
------------------

JNLACTINCMPLT, Mupip journal action might be incomplete

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that MUPIP did not finish to completion successfully.

Action: Review and analyze the accompanying message(s).


---------------------
JNLALIGNSZCHG
---------------------

JNLALIGNSZCHG, Journal ALIGNSIZE is rounded up to xxxx blocks (closest next higher power of two)

Run Time Information: This indicates that the ALIGNSIZE specified in the MUPIP SET JOURNAL command was not a perfect power of two. It has been rounded up to the closest next higher power of two and the new journal file created (if any) will use this value for ALIGNSIZE.

Action: -


--------------------
JNLALIGNTOOSM 
--------------------

JNLALIGNTOOSM, Alignsize xxxx (bytes) is smaller than block size yyyy (bytes) for aaaa bbbb. Using alignsize of cccc (bytes) instead.

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that the specified alignsize xxxx is smaller than the specified block size yyyy for the mentioned region/database (aaaa) file bbbb. MUPIP will use the default cccc bytes instead of the specified xxxx.

Action: If the alignsize cccc used is not acceptable, choose some other legal value for alignsize and reissue the command.

---------------------
JNLALLOCGROW 
---------------------

JNLALLOCGROW, Increased Journal ALLOCATION from [ssss blocks] to [aaaa blocks] to match AUTOSWITCHLIMIT for ffff nnnn

GDE/MUPIP Information: The utility increased the journal allocation value from ssss to aaaa for the journal files associated with ffff nnnn, which is either "database file" followed by a database file name or "region" followed by a region name. This indicates that the specified journal allocation and journal extension values combined exceed the specified journal autoswitchlimit and the utility has adjusted the journal allocation value accordingly.

Action: None required.

-------------------------
JNLBADLABEL 
-------------------------

JNLBADLABEL, Specified File xxxx fdoes not have a YottaDB Journal File Label

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the journal file indicated in the accompanying previous message does not match the expected format.

Action: If a command specification caused this error, determine whether the command has the proper file-specification. Make sure the journal file was created by the current YottaDB version. Also ensure that a process is not using a journal file-specification for some other purpose.


---------------------
JNLBADRECFMT 
---------------------

JNLBADRECFMT, Journal Record Format Error encountered for file xxxx at disk address yyyy

MUPIP Error: This indicates that MUPIP has found an error in the journal file.

Action: Report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel.

Run Time Error: When the last process with write access to a journaled database exits, it does a cleanup of the journal file by attempting to get an exclusive write lock on the journal file. If that fails after waiting for nearly one minute, it issues this error.

Action: Attempt MUPIP RUNDOWN on the region making sure to run down all processes actively attached to this database. If the error persists even after no one is attached, contact your YottaDB support channel before proceeding.

----------------------
JNLQIOSALVAGE 
----------------------

JNLQIOSALVAGE, Journal IO lock salvaged

Run Time Information: An active process salvaged a critical resource marked as belonging to a no longer active (terminated) process during a journal flush.

Action: The system automatically returns the critical resource to normal operation and continues execution. If this message continues to occur, please investigate why the process holding the crit abnormally exited.

--------------------
JNLRDERR
--------------------

JNLRDERR, Error reading journal file xxxx: unable to initialize.

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB encountered an error while trying to read from the journal file xxxx. This can happen if the journal file size is less than the minimum size of the journal file header, or if the journal-file-specification does not match the intended file, or if the intended file is not accessible by the processes that update the database. YottaDB automatically attempts to create a new journal file. If the attempt to create a new journal file fails, YottaDB issues another error and the intended update is lost and does not get registered in the database and journal.

Action: To reestablish durability, perform a MUPIP BACKUP that switches to a new set of journal files.


-----------------
JNLRDONLY 
-----------------

--------------------

JNLSWITCHTOOSM, Journal AUTOSWITCHLIMIT [aaaa blocks] is less than journal ALLOCATION [bbbb blocks] for database file xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that the value of AUTOSWITCHLIMIT specified in a MUPIP SET JOURNAL command is less than the default or specified value of ALLOCATION. This error also indicates that the AUTOSWITCHLIMIT value specified was greater or equal to the ALLOCATION but in turn got rounded down, and this rounded down value is lesser than the ALLOCATION.

Action: Specify a higher value of AUTOSWITCHLIMIT.


------------------
JNLTMQUAL1 
------------------

JNLTMQUAL1, Time qualifier BEFORE_TIME=xxxx is less than SINCE_TIME=yyyy

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the specified before time xxxx is earlier than the since time yyyy.

Action: Specify correct values for time qualifiers and make sure that BEFORE_TIME is specified to be later than the SINCE_TIME.

------------------
JNLTMQUAL2 
------------------

JNLTMQUAL2, Time qualifier LOOKBACK_TIME=xxxx is later than SINCE_TIME=yyyy

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the specified lookback time xxxx is later than the since time yyyy.

Action: Specify correct values for time qualifiers and make sure that the LOOKBACK_TIME qualifier is set to an earlier time value than the SINCE_TIME qualifier.


-------------------
JNLTMQUAL3 
-------------------

JNLTMQUAL3, Time qualifier BEFORE_TIME=xxxx is less than the journal file(s) minimum timestamp=yyyy

MUPIP Error: This error indicates that the -BEFORE_TIME xxxx is earlier than the earliest timestamp yyyy found in the journal file(s).

Action: Issue the MUPIP command again with an appropriate value for -BEFORE_TIME. Note that journal files record time based on a UTC clock, which is time zone independent, while MUPIP interprets time-based input based your local clock and adjusts its actions accordingly. If you use a local clock (in UNIX, set by the TZ environment variable) that is subject to significant shifts, such as between standard time and daylight savings, when the time shifts back (for example, from daylight to standard), the time change may cause this error. One way to address this is to, possibly temporarily, switch your local time setting to UTC.

--------------------
JNLTMQUAL4 
--------------------

JNLTMQUAL4, Time qualifier BEFORE_TIME="xxxx is less than AFTER_TIME="yyyy"

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the specified BEFORE_TIME xxxx is earlier than the AFTER_TIME yyyy specified

Action: Specify correct values for the time qualifiers and make sure that AFTER_TIME is earlier than BEFORE_TIME qualifier.

----------------------
JNLTNOUTOFSEQ
----------------------

MUPIP Error: MUPIP JOURNAL FORWARD command has found that the transaction numbers (aaaa and bbbb) of two consecutive generation journal files (xxxx and yyyy) are not in sequence. It is expected that the end transaction of a journal file is the same as the begin transaction of the immediately succeeding generation.

Action: Ensure the specification of journal file names is as intended. Verify if the journal file xxxx and yyyy are really in sequence. Find out if any of the transactions are missing or duplicate using MUPIP JOURNAL SHOW=HEAD FORWARD NOVERIFY. If appropriate, force forward recovery using the NOTNCHECK qualifier.

------------------------
JNLTPNEST
------------------------

JNLTPNEST, Mupip journal command found nested TP transactions for journal file jjjj at offset oooo at transaction number nnnn

MUPIP Warning: MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER or ROLLBACK encountered a TSTART record for transaction nnnn at offset oooo in journal file jjjj while already processing an uncommitted transaction. Since the run-time system should never produce this situation, the journal file is suspect. MUPIP discards the in-progress transaction and proceeds.

Action: Extract the journal file(s) and use the context from the message to find the transactions in question and adjust for any lost or tangled transaction(s).


------------------------
JNLTRANS2BIG 
------------------------

JNLTRANS2BIG, Transaction needs an estimated [aaaa blocks] in journal file xxxx which exceeds the AUTOSWITCHLIMIT of bbbb

Run Time Error: This indicates that a database update transaction needs aaaa blocks of space in the journal file for its corresponding journal records and this exceeds the AUTOSWITCHLIMIT value of the current journal file.

Action: Increase the AUTOSWITCHLIMIT, or if the transaction is a TP transaction decrease the number of updates done within one transaction thereby decreasing its journal file space requirement.


-------------------------
JNLTRANSGTR 
-------------------------

JNLTRANSGTR, Transaction number in journal is greater than in database

Run Time Warning: This indicates that YottaDB was unable to open the journal file because its transaction number does not match the database files transaction number

Run Time Error: This indicates that a JOB command specified an entry reference that could not be located in the image used by the new job.

Action: Verify that the image being JOBbed is properly linked. If the image has been changed since it was last LINKed, determine whether the new job has access to the files necessary to ZLINK the changes. You can also LINK the image to include the changes.


---------------------
JOBLVN2LONG 
---------------------

JOBLVN2LONG, The zwrite representation of a local variable transferred to a JOB'd process is too long. The zwrite representation cannot exceed MMMM. Encountered size: LLLL

Run Time Error: This error indicates that the total length LLLL (in bytes) of the ZWRITE representation of the variable name, subscripts, and value exceeds the maximum MMMM supported by the PASSCURLVN facility. Note that the ZWRITE representation contains the appropriate punctuation for any subscripts, the equal-sign and replaces any non-graphic characters with their $[Z]CHAR() representations.

Action: Consider whether the JOB'd process needs the variable(s) that exceed the maximum for PASSCURLVN - if not, they can be taken out of scope before the JOB command. Alternatively, pass them using global variables or a local SOCKET device.

----------------------
JOBLVNDETAIL 
----------------------

JOBLVNDETAIL, The zwrite representation of a local variable transferred to a JOB'd process is too long. The zwrite representation cannot exceed XXXX. Encountered size: YYYY

Action: Look for and correct typographical errors.

-----------------
KILLABANDONED 
-----------------

KILLABANDONED, Abandoned kills counter is greater than zero for file ffff, tttt

Run Time Error: This indicates a process terminated during KILL cleanup in database file ffff; tttt is text waring of the implications. Generally, this leaves a database with block incorrectly marked busy errors. Such errors are benign in that they only cause blocks to be inappropriately unavailable. Nonetheless they should be addressed promptly to avoid operators becoming desensitized to errors in INTEGs.

Action: Use DSE MAP to carefully FREE individual incorrectly marked busy block. If there are many blocks, you can edit the output of the integ (run with NOMAP) to create a script for driving repeated DSE MAP FREE. Alternatively, if you can get standalone access, to the database you may use DSE MAP RESTORE - never use MAP RESTORE on an active database.

-------------------
KILLBYSIG 
-------------------

KILLBYSIG, Process xxxx has been killed by a signal yyyy

Action: Determine whether to change the current character set or redo the EXTRACT with a different character set. Alternatively, you can edit the extract file so the EXTRACT file header matches the gtm_chset environment variable. This enables an M mode MUPIP LOAD to treat the input as a byte stream or a UTF-8 mode MUPIP LOAD, which either detects BADCHAR errors or not, depending on the setting of the gtm_badchar environment variable..

-------------------
LOADRUNNING
-------------------

LOADRUNNING, Cannot ZLINK an active routine xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that a ZLINK specified a routine xxxx, that is currently on the M invocation stack. A routine cannot be altered in the image if its current form may be required for continued processing.

Action: ZLINK the routine prior to or after running it. Use QUIT or ZGOTO to remove the routine from the M stack.

-----------------------
LOCALSOCKREQ
-----------------------

LOCALSOCKREQ, LOCAL socket required

Run Time Error: The operation attempted requires a LOCAL socket, and a non-LOCAL (TCP) socket was specified.

Action: Make sure the correct socket is being used and that the socket is OPENed with the ":LOCAL" suffix. ZSHOW "D"may provide useful details on the current socket state.

------------------------
LOCKINCR2HIGH 
------------------------

LOCKINCR2HIGH, Attempt to increment a LOCK more than LLLL times

Run Time Error: This message indicates that a LOCK + command attempted to increase a LOCK increment higher than LLLL (the maximum level). The following associated message gives the resource name for the LOCK that failed.

Action: Examine the application for pathological use of incremental LOCKs (LOCK +) and ensure that no process LOCKs a single resource more than 511 increments with no intervening decrements (LOCK -) for that resource or lock releases (LOCK with no + or - in its argument).

-------------------
LOCKIS 
-------------------

LOCKIS, Resource name: RRRR

Run Time Information: This message identifies a lock resource.

Action: Refer to the accompanying message(s) for more information.

------------------
LOCKSPACEFULL 
------------------

LOCKSPACEFULL, No more room for LOCK slots on database file ffff

Run Time Error: This indicates that the environment attempted more concurrent M LOCKs than the configured LOCK_SPACE for file ffff can support.

Action: Analyze the LOCK protocol for efficiency. Use mupip set -file -lock_space=size ffff to increase the lock space for region xxx. To avoid the same problem the next time you recreate the database, use GDE to make the analogous change to lock_space for the segment mapped to the ffff file in the global directory used to MUPIP CREATE this region

-------------------
LOCKSPACEINFO 
-------------------

LOCKSPACEINFO, Region: rrrr: processes on queue: pppp/qqqq; LOCK slots in use: llll/kkkk; name space not full

Run Time Error: This indicates that the environment attempted more concurrent M LOCKs than the configured LOCK_SPACE for region rrrr can support. pppp processes are waiting on a lock. llll locks are in use. qqqq and kkkk indicate maximum number of process queue entries, and maximum number of locks respectively.

Action: Analyze the LOCK protocol for efficiency. Use mupip set -region -lock_space=size "rrrr" to increase the lock space for region rrrr. To avoid the same problem the next time you recreate the database, use GDE to make the analogous change to lock_space for the segment mapped to the ffff file in the global directory used to MUPIP CREATE this region.

-------------------
LOCKSPACEUSE
-------------------

LOCKSPACEUSE, Estimated free lock space: xxx% of pppp pages.

LKE Information: SHOW command displays the amount of free space along with the number of pages configured for lock space.

Action: If the free lock space report does not show a comfortable amount of free space, use MUPIP SET -LOCK_SPACE to increase the space; remember to also use GDE to revise the LOCK_SPACE in the global directory used to create the region in question so the change remains when the database is recreated.

--------------------
LOCKSUB2LONG 
--------------------

LOCKSUB2LONG, Following subscript is xxxx bytes long which exceeds 255 byte limit.

Run Time Error: This indicates that one of the substrings of a lock is taking more than 255 bytes. Check the following message to see which substring caused this error.

Action: Make sure none of the substrings are larger than 255 bytes. If UTF-8 is enabled, use the encoded byte length rather the character length for the key size.

---------------------
LOCKTIMINGINTP 
---------------------

LOCKTIMINGINTP, A LOCK at pppp within a TP transaction is waiting in a final TP retry, which may lead to a general response gap

Run Time Warning: This message indicates that a LOCK command at location pppp with a non-zero (0) or no timeout and within a critical resource holding retry of a TP transaction is waiting to acquire a resource currently owned by another process. This condition may cause other processes to pause for perceptible periods. The associated LOCKIS message identifies the LOCK resource name.

Action: Examine the application, especially at pppp, for pathological use of LOCKs within TP. A zero (0) timeout prevents this warning. Note that YottaDB recommends avoiding the use of LOCK commands within TP transactions.

------------------
LOGOFF 
------------------

LOGOFF, No longer logging to file xxxx

GDE Information: This indicates that a LOG command with the qualifier OFF terminated logging of GDE commands to log file xxxx.

Action: When appropriate, resume logging with LOG and the qualifier ON[=]. GDE closes the log file(s) at the end of the GDE session.

--------------------
LOGON
--------------------

LOGON, Logging to file xxxx

GDE Information: This indicates that a LOG command with the qualifier ON[=] initiated the logging of GDE commands to log file xxxx.

Action: You can suspend logging with LOG and the qualifier OFF.

-------------------
LOGTOOLONG 
-------------------

LOGTOOLONG, Environment variable eeee is too long. Maximum length allowed is llll bytes.

Information: This error is triggered whenever the length of an environment variable that YottaDB cares about exceeds the maximum allowed limit.

Action: The maximum allowed limit is indicated in the message. Specify a value for the environment variable within this length.

-------------------
LOWSPACECRE 
-------------------

LOWSPACECRE, Disk space for database file xxxx is not enough for yyyy future extension. aaaa blocks are needed, only bbbb available.

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that the database file xxxx was created but it was found that the file system/volume does not have enough space for even yyyy future extensions.

Action: Check the allocations and extension sizes specified in the Global Directory. If no extensions are anticipated, no action is required. Otherwise, consider moving some files to another file system/volume, or reconfiguring the file system/volume housing the database file.

-------------------
LPARENMISSING
-------------------

LPARENMISSING, Left parenthesis expected

Compile Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB did not find a left parenthesis in the next source position.

Action: Look for invalid subscripts in indirection operations and errors in SET $PIECE commands.

---------------
LPARENREQD 
---------------

LPARENREQD, xxxx Left parenthesis expected

MUPIP Error: This indicates that LOAD failed because it found xxxx in the input stream where it expected to find a left parenthesis.

Action: Refer to the topic `MUPIP LOAD Errors in the About This Manual section <https://docs.yottadb.com/MessageRecovery/about.html#mupip-load-errors>`_.

-----------------
LQLENGTHNA 
-----------------

LQLENGTHNA, Listening queue length xxxx not appropriate, it should be between 1 and 5

Run Time Error: This indicates that the YottaDB listening queue restricts the number of pending connections between one (1) and five (5).

Action: Specify the number of pending connections in the queue as a number between one and five.

-----------------
LSEXPECTED 
-----------------

LSEXPECTED, A line separator is expected here

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a source line did not specify a space or tab before the first command.

Action: Look for and correct typographical errors. If missing, put a tab or space at the beginning of the line.

-----------------
LSINSERTED
-----------------

LSINSERTED, Line YYYY, source module XXXX exceeds maximum source line length; line seperator inserted, terminating scope of any prior IF, ELSE, or FOR

Compile Time Warning: Indicates that source XXXX line YYYY exceeded the maximum line length and YottaDB separated it into multiple lines to allow continued parsing. Internally, YottaDB represents the generated code as N lines for this source line, where N is the number of segments extracted from this source line. Be aware that as a result of this, source lines containing a command whose scope is rest of the line (IF, ELSE, FOR), are now split into multiple lines, each with a separate scope.

Action: Consider refactoring code to avoid source line lengths in excess of 8192 characters.

---------------
LVNULLSUBS 
---------------

LVNULLSUBS, LVNULLSUBS Null subscripts not allowed in local variables

Run Time Error: This indicates that an attempt was made to set a local variable with null subscript.

Action: Modify the subscript generation to avoid the null subscript or change the LVNULLSUBS parameter for this job or process. For information on changing LVNULLSUBS, refer to documentation on GTM$DEFAULTS and the VIEW command in the `Programmer's Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/ProgrammersGuide/index.html>`_.

-----------------
LVORDERARG 
-----------------

LVORDERARG, Argument to local variable $NEXT must be subscripted

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a $NEXT function specified an unsubscripted local variable as an argument.

Action: Use the $ORDER function or ZWRITE command to display local variables.

----------------
LVSTARALON
----------------

LVSTARALON, The * name cannot be deleted or renamed

GDE Error: This indicates that a DELETE or RENAME command attempted to delete or rename the * namespace. The * namespace is protected because it is associated with namespaces that are not explicitly mapped.

Action: None.

----------------
MALLOCMAXUNIX 
----------------

MALLOCMAXUNIX, Exceeded maximum allocation defined by $gtm_max_storalloc.

Run Time Error: This error accompanies a MEMORY error as a secondary error to indicate that the limit the process hit was not an OS limit but one artificially defined by the $gtm_max_storalloc environment variable.

Action: Increase the value of, or unset, $gtm_max_storalloc, or identify the source of the memory consumption (for example, creating and keeping lots of local variables) and reduce it.

-------------------
MAPBAD 
-------------------

MAPBAD, xxxx for yyyy does not exist

GDE Information: This indicates that a NAME points to a REGION or a REGION points to a SEGMENT that does not exist. xxxx is the missing object. yyyy describes the type of the object. When you enter the VERIFY or EXIT command, GDE displays this message after it verifies the global directory.

Action: Use the ADD command to add the REGION or SEGMENT.

------------------
MAPDUP 
------------------

MAPDUP, xxxx and yyyy both map to zzzz

GDE Information: This indicates that GDE encountered two REGIONs mapped to the same SEGMENT or two SEGMENTS mapped to the same FILE. xxxx and yyyy are the REGIONS or SEGMENTS with the same mapping. zzzz is the SEGMENT or FILE with more than one mapping. When you enter the VERIFY or EXIT command, GDE displays this message after it verifies the global directory.

Action: Delete mappings to eliminate duplication.

----------------
MAXACTARG 
----------------

MAXACTARG, Maximum number of actual arguments exceeded

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a DO or extrinsic function supplied an actuallist with more than 32 elements.

Action: Modify the routine so that it passes fewer parameters explicitly.

--------------
MAXARGCNT 
--------------

MAXARGCNT, Maximum number of arguments xxxx exceeded

Compile Time/Run Time Error: If this error occurs during compilation, it indicates that a command or function specified more than xxxx arguments. If this error occurs during run-time execution, it indicates that a SET of a $ZROUTINES has more than the allowed number of elements in an array. The maximum number of arguments is xxxx.

Action: If this error occurs during compilation, it indicates that a command or function specified more than xxxx arguments. If this error occurs during run-time execution, it indicates that a SET of a $ZROUTINES has more than the allowed number of elements in an array. The maximum number of arguments is xxxx.

---------------
MAXBTLEVEL 
---------------

MAXBTLEVEL, Global ^gggg in region rrrr reached maximum level

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that the global-variable-tree for global xxxx reached the maximum level permissible. Very likely, MUPIP REORG was specified with a fill-factor much less than 100. Small fill-factors can cause REORG to revise existing GDS-blocks (in order to accommodate the fill-factor requirement), in turn causing block-splits, which might lead to an increase of the tree height. Alternatively a SET or MERGE has made the global really too large for the current block size, which is most likely to happen with large (spanning) database nodes. Note that if this message does not specify the global name, it means the directory tree for the region hit the limit - YottaDB believes the directory tree full condition is almost impossible to create in practice.

Action: If MUPIP reorg was specified with a small fill-factor, try higher number (close to 100) to reduce tree-height. Other techniques include increasing GDS-block-size, reducing reserved bytes, killing unwanted portions of the tree or moving some nodes in the global to a different database region.

--------------------
MAXFORARGS
--------------------

MAXFORARGS, Maximum number of arguments to a single FOR command exceeded

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a FOR statement specified more than 127 arguments.

Action: Modify the routine so that it uses fewer arguments in one FOR command.

-------------------
MAXGTMPATH 
-------------------

MAXGTMPATH, The executing module path is greater than the maximum xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that the path specified for the mumps executable environment variable has a length limitation of xxxx.

Action: Move the directory or use a link to shorten the path.

------------------
MAXNRSUBSCRIPTS 
------------------

MAXNRSUBSCRIPTS, Maximum number of subscripts exceeded

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a subscripted variable exceeded the maximum limit of 31 subscripts.

Action: Modify the routine to observe this limit on subscripts in a single variable.

------------------
MAXSEMGETRETRY 
------------------

MAXSEMGETRETRY, Failed to get ftok semaphore after tttt tries because it is being continually deleted

Run Time Error: A process was unable to open a database file because on every one of tttt tries it found something kept deleting the IPC semaphore that gates access to the file.

Action: Check for one or more rogue processes disrupting IPC semaphore, or for damage to the Operating System semaphore services.

--------------------
MAXSSREACHED 
--------------------

MAXSSREACHED, Maximum snapshots - mmmm - for region rrrr reached. Please wait for the existing snapshots to complete before starting a new one.

MUPIP Error: Starting this snapshot would exceed the maximum number of snapshots.

Action: Wait for a currently active process using snapshots to complete or terminate an existing snapshot activity.

---------------------
MAXSTRLEN 
---------------------

MAXSTRLEN, Maximum string length exceeded

Run Time Error: This indicates that a string exceeded the maximum limit of 1,048,576 bytes. In M mode, each byte holds a character, but in UTF-8 mode, a character may take between one and four bytes.

Action: Modify the routine so it uses shorter strings.

-------------------
MAXTRACEHEIGHT
-------------------

MAXTRACEHEIGHT, <The maximum trace tree height (xxxx) has been exceeded. The trace information will be incomplete>

Run Time Information: The internal YottaDB data structure used to gather information during M Profiling can not hold all the information.

Action: Not all lines executed will be reported in the global specified by VIEW "TRACE". There is no impact on the actual execution of the user program. Report the entire incident context with all information necessary to reproduce this error to your YottaDB support channel.

-------------------
MAXTRACELEVEL 
-------------------

MAXTRACELEVEL, The maximum traceable level of xxxx has been exceeded. The frame information will not be maintained.

Run Time Information: This indicates that M profiling reached the maximum level ($ZLEVEL) it can manage. The information for frames will not be maintained from this point on. Line information is maintained and reported correctly and information gathered about frames upto this point will be reported. Further MAXTRACELEVEL errors will not be reported to the users.

Action: Determine if the number of levels of execution is as intended, if not, correct the application.

--------------------
MAXTRIGNEST
--------------------

MAXTRIGNEST, Maximum trigger nesting level LLLL exceeded

Trigger/Run Time Error: YottaDB limits trigger invocation depth to LLLL.

Action: If you are sure that you do not have an application code bug or misfeature, reduce the depth of trigger invocation, possibly by consolidating triggers.

---------------------
MBXRDONLY
---------------------

MBXRDONLY, Mailbox is read only, cannot write to it

Run Time Error: This indicates that a WRITE command attempted to access a mailbox that was opened read-only.

Action: Verify that the routine is using the right mailbox and that the mailbox was opened with the appropriate deviceparameter.

--------------------
MBXWRTONLY
--------------------

MBXWRTONLY, Mailbox is write only, cannot read from it

Run Time Error: This indicates that a READ command attempted to access a mailbox that was opened write-only.

Action: Verify that the routine is using the correct mailbox and that the mailbox was opened with the appropriate deviceparameter.

--------------------
MEMORY 
--------------------

MEMORY, Central memory exhausted during request for xxxx bytes

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that the compiler or the run-time system could not allocate sufficient storage.

Action: Look for very large variables. This error can also be caused by problems in the YottaDB environment, such as using components of different versions or different platforms. Verify that there is no such problem in the environment.

----------------------
MEMORYRECURSIVE 
----------------------

MEMORYRECURSIVE, Memory Subsystem called recursively

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB made an error calling the memory subsystem.

Action: Report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel.

----------------------
MERGEDESC 
----------------------

MERGEDESC, Merge operation not possible. xxxx is descendent of yyyy.

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB was not able to MERGE xxxx into yyyy or vice versa, because xxxx is a descendent of yyyy. When merging global variables specifications included extended references, the MERGE command issues a MERGDESC error if any part of the source or target tree, as mapped, is a descendant of the other. In MERGE ^|"x.gld"| a(1)=^|"mumps.gld"| ^a there is no error if mumps.gld maps ^a to different database files than those to which x.gld maps ^a(1). A MERGDESC error occurs if any part of ^a as mapped by mumps.gld overlaps any part of ^a(1) as mapped by x.gld.

Action: Modify the routine to avoid MERGE operation between two variables where one is the descendant of the other.

----------------------
MERGEINCOMPL 
----------------------

MERGEINCOMPL, Error encountered during MERGE; operation may be incomplete

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB was not able to complete MERGE operation.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information.

----------------------
MISSINGDELIM 
----------------------

MISSINGDELIM, Delimiter dddd expected before qqqq vvvv

GDE Error: This indicates that the delimiter dddd (usually dash character) is expected just before vvvv is specified. vvvv is a GDE object or qualifier indicated by qqqq.

Action: Specify the delimiter as indicated.

----------------------
MMBEFOREJNL
----------------------

MMBEFOREJNL, BEFORE image journaling cannot be set with MM access method in database file ffff

MUPIP Error: MM access method is incompatible with BEFORE_IMAGE journaling.

Action: If you require BEFORE_IMAGE journaling, use the BG access method. If you wish to use MM, turn off BEFORE_IMAGE journaling before selection MM as the access method.

--------------------
MMFILETOOLARGE 
--------------------

MMFILETOOLARGE, Size of rrrr region (ffff) is larger than maximum size supported for memory mapped I/O on this platform.

Run Time Error: YottaDB and its Utility programs issue this to indicate an attempt to open the database ffff corresponding to region rrrr when the size of the database file is greater than the maximum size supported for memory mapped I/O.

Action: Consider as appropriate: migrating to a platform not having this limitation, using more, but smaller, regions, or using the BG access method.

-------------------
MMNOBEFORIMG 
-------------------

MMNOBEFORIMG, MM segments do not support before image journaling

GDE Information: This indicates that a JOURNAL=BEFORE_IMAGE region qualifier appeared on a segment that has segment qualifier ACCESS_METHOD=MM.

Action: Change the segment qualifier to ACCESS_METHOD=BG or use NOBEFORE_IMAGE for the region.

----------------------
MMNOBFORRPL 
----------------------

MMNOBFORRPL, Replication cannot be used in database file ffff which uses MM access method and NOBEFORE image journaling

MUPIP Error: You can't turn on replcation for MM access method database file ffff.

Action: Forgo replication for the file or change the access method to BG.

-----------------------
MMNODYNDWNGRD 
-----------------------

MMNODYNDWNGRD, Unable to use dynamic downgrade with MM access method for region xxx. Use BG access method for downgrade

Run Time/MUPIP Error: An attempt was made to use MM mode on a database that has not completed being downgraded. MM mode is only supported on fully downgraded or fully upgraded databases.

Action: Use MUPIP SET FILE or MUPIP SET REGION with the ACCESS_METHOD parameter to set the access mode to BG. Then complete the file downgrade using MUPIP REORG DOWNGRADE or file upgrade using MUPIP REORG UPGRADE. And finally set the access mode back to MM using the MUPIP SET FILE or MUPIP SET REGION command again.

---------------------
MMNODYNUPGRD 
---------------------

MMNODYNUPGRD, Unable to use MM access method for region yyy until all database blocks are upgraded

Run Time/MUPIP Error: An attempt was made to use MM mode on a database that has not completed being upgraded. MM mode is only supported on fully upgraded databases.

Action: Use MUPIP SET FILE or MUPIP SET REGION with the ACCESS_METHOD parameter to set the access mode to BG. Then complete the file upgrade using MUPIP REORG UPGRADE. And finally set the access mode back to MM using the MUPIP SET FILE or MUPIP SET REGION command again.

-----------------------
MMREGNOACCESS 
-----------------------

MMREGNOACCESS, Region rrrr (ffff) is no longer accessible. See prior error messages in the operator and application error logs

Run Time Error: Issued when a process attempts to access region rrrr corresponding to database file ffff (opened with the MM access method) which previously became inaccessible to this process due to failure during file extension.

Action: Review the operator log for DBFILERR messages and application error logs for GBLOFLOW status to diagnose the circumstances for the earlier failure of memory mapped I/O operations and take corrective action.

------------------------
MPROFRUNDOWN 
------------------------

MPROFRUNDOWN, Error during M-profiling rundown

Run Time Error: During process exit, YottaDB attempted to store the results of an M-profiling trace but encountered an error.

Action: Report this database error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

---------------------
MRTMAXEXCEEDED
---------------------

MRTMAXEXCEEDED, Maximum value of xxxx for SOCKET deviceparameter MOREREADTIME exceeded.

Compile Time/Run Time Error: YottaDB triggers this error when MOREREADTIME exceeds its maximum value of 999ms.

Action: Specify a value between 1 and 999. Never set MOREREADTIME to 0 as it may cause a CPU to "spin". See `"Input/Output Processing" Chapter of the Programmer's Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/ProgrammersGuide/ioproc.html>`_ for more information.

----------------------
MTANSIFOR 
----------------------

MTANSIFOR, Use of ANSI labels does not allow stream format

Run Time Error: This indicates that the LABEL="ANSI" device parameter appeared in a device command for a tape with STREAM format.

Action: Modify the format to FIXED or VARIABLE, delete the LABEL device parameter, or use LABEL="DOS11" for STREAM format.

---------------------
MTANSILAB 
---------------------

MTANSILAB, Tape label is not in valid ANSI format

Run Time Error: This indicates that the magnetic tape device driver expected an ANSI label but did not find one.

Action: Verify that the tape was properly made and that current processing device parameters match.

-----------------------
MTBLKTOOBIG
-----------------------

MTBLKTOOBIG, Magtape BLOCK_SIZE exceeds maximum size allowed

Run Time Error: This indicates that an OPEN command specified a BLOCK_SIZE deviceparameter that is larger than this type of tape can accommodate.

Action: Review the routine to ensure that block sizes do not exceed host I/O driver limitations.

------------------
MTBLKTOOSM 
------------------

MTBLKTOOSM, Magtape BLOCK_SIZE is less than xxxx bytes

Run Time Error: This indicates that an OPEN command specified a BLOCK_SIZE device parameter that is smaller than this type of tape can handle.

Action: Review the program to ensure that block sizes do not fall below host driver limitations. For example, the industry standard for 9-track tapes is to treat blocks smaller than 14 bytes as noise in an inter-record gap.

---------------------
MTDOSFOR 
---------------------

MTDOSFOR, Use of DOS-11 labels requires stream format

Run Time Error: This indicates that the LABEL="DOS11" deviceparameter appeared in a device command for a tape with FIXED or VARIABLE format.

Action: Modify the format to STREAM, delete the LABEL deviceparameter, or use LABEL="ANSI" for FIXED or VARIABLE format.

-------------------
MTDOSLAB 
-------------------

MTDOSLAB, Tape label is not in valid DOS-11 format

Run Time Error: This indicates that the magnetic tape device driver did not find the expected DOS11.

Action: Verify that the tape was properly made and that the current processing deviceparameters match.

--------------------
MTFIXRECSZ 
--------------------

MTFIXRECSZ, BLOCK_SIZE xxxx must be a multiple of fixed record size yyyy

Run Time Error: This indicates that an OPEN command specified a BLOCK_SIZE that is not a multiple of its FIXED RECORDSIZE.

Action: Ensure that the block size is evenly divisible by the record size.

-------------------
MTINVLAB
-------------------

MTINVLAB, Invalid label type specified in magtape OPEN

Run Time Error: This indicates that the LABEL= deviceparameter appeared in a device command for a tape with an argument evaluating to arguments other than "DOS11" or "ANSI", which are the only valid ones.

Action: Remove or modify the LABEL=.

----------------------
MTIOERR
----------------------

MTIOERR, I/O Error with magnetic tape device xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that an attempt to access a magnetic tape encountered a hardware error on tape drive xxxx.

Action: Review accompanying system error messages. If appropriate, try another tape or another drive. Initiate diagnostics on the tape drive in question.

------------------------
MTIS
------------------------

MTIS, Magnetic tape: xxxx

Run Time Information: This message identifies magnetic tape xxxx as the current device at the time of an error.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information.

----------------------
MTNOSKIP 
----------------------

MTNOSKIP, SKIP operation not supported on this device

Run Time Error: This indicates that the program attempted to use the SKIP deviceparameter for a type of tape that is not able to SKIP.

Action: Remove the SKIP deviceparameter or select a type of tape that supports SKIP.

--------------------
MTRDBADBLK 
--------------------

MTRDBADBLK, Block read too small, contained only xxxx bytes, block size = yyyy

Run Time Error: This indicates that a READ command encountered a block on the tape that contained xxxx bytes, which is less than the BLOCKSIZE=yyyy deviceparameter specified.

Action: Verify that the proper tape is mounted and that the appropriate BLOCKSIZE is used when OPENing the magtape.

---------------------
MTRDONLY
---------------------

MTRDONLY, Cannot write to a READONLY magtape

Run Time Error: This indicates that a WRITE command attempted to access a read-only tape.

Action: Verify that the proper tape is mounted. If the tape is to be written, insert the write ring and remount. If the tape is properly mounted, ensure that the tape was OPENed NOREADONLY.

----------------------
MTRDTHENWRT 
----------------------

MTRDTHENWRT, Attempt to read after a write to a magtape

Run Time Error: This indicates that a READ command followed a WRITE command to a magnetic tape with no intervening positioning toward the beginning of the tape.

Action: Look for a logic problem or a missing USE command. If previously written data is to be read, the tape must first be repositioned by a REWIND, a SKIP, or a SPACE with negative arguments.

---------------------
MTRECGTRBLK 
---------------------

MTRECGTRBLK, Magtape record size cannot exceed block size

Run Time Error: This indicates that an OPEN command attempted to initialize a magnetic tape with a RECORDSIZE that exceeds the BLOCKSIZE.

Action: Review the program and modify the value for BLOCKSIZE or RECORDSIZE.

--------------------
MTRECTOOBIG 
--------------------

MTRECTOOBIG, Magtape record size exceeds maximum allowed

Run Time Error: This indicates that an OPEN command attempted to initialize a magnetic tape with a RECORDSIZE larger than this type of tape can accommodate. Note that the maximum size allowed may depend on whether the records are FIXED or VARIABLE.

Action: Modify the routine to use smaller record sizes.

-------------------
MTRECTOOSM 
-------------------

MTRECTOOSM, Magtape record size is too small for record type

Run Time Error: This indicates that an OPEN command attempted to initialize a magnetic tape with a variable length record size that is smaller than this type of tape can accommodate.

Action: Modify the routine to use a larger record size or use FIXED length records.

---------------------
MUBCKNODIR 
---------------------

MUBCKNODIR, MUPIP backup aborted due to error in output directory

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the output directory specified in a BACKUP command could not receive the output file.

Action: Use the host shell commands to verify that the output directory exists, that it is properly protected, and has enough space.

-------------------------
MUCREFILERR
-------------------------

MUCREFILERR, Error in/at EEEE creating database DDDD (region RRRR)

Run Time Error: Message accompanying another message indicating the failure to create an autodb database file. EEEE indicates the $ZPOSITION of the application which made the global reference that attempted to bring the database file into existence.

Action: Use the preceding message to diagnose and correct the problem, which may include missing environment variables and/or insufficient space or user privileges. Consider whether autodb creation is appropriate for this database file.

--------------------
MUDWNGRDNOTPOS 
--------------------

MUDWNGRDNOTPOS, Start VBN value is [xxx] while downgraded YottaDB version can support only [yyy]. Downgrade not possible

MUPIP Error: Older versions of YottaDB require the first GDS block be at Virtual Block Number yyy but it is at VBN xxx. This is likely due to the file initially being created using a newer version of YottaDB and thus cannot be downgraded.

Action: To use the database with an older version of YottaDB, it must be extracted with the current version and loaded into the older version both in ZWR format.

----------------------
MUDWNGRDNRDY 
----------------------

MUDWNGRDNRDY, Database xxx is not ready to downgrade - still yyy database blocks to downgrade

MUPIP Error: A MUPIP DOWNGRADE was attempted when the file-header blks_to_upgrd counter was not equal to the database used block count. This means that not all database blocks have been converted to the previous format.

Action: Before the database file-header can be downgraded, all of the blocks in the database must be downgraded to the previous format. This is normally accomplished with MUPIP REORG DOWNGRADE. If this fails to set the counter correctly, run MUPIP INTEG (not FAST) on the region which will compute and set the correct counter.

------------------------
MUDWNGRDTN
------------------------

--------------------

MUTEXFRCDTERM, Mutual Exclusion subsystem detected forced termination of process xxxx. Crit salvaged from database file dddd.

Run Time Warning: This indicates that YottaDB confirmed inappropriate termination of the process xxxx, while holding crit on database file dddd.

Action: Determine the cause of the termination and take appropriate action.

---------------------
MUTEXLCKALERT 
---------------------

MUTEXLCKALERT, Mutual Exclusion subsystem ALERT - Lock attempt threshold crossed for region rrrr. Process pppp is in crit cycle cccc.

Run Time Error: This warning indicates that a process could not obtain a critical section lock for region rrrr even after waiting longer than the YottaDB determined threshold (approximately 45 seconds) because the critical section lock was held that entire time by another process pppp. cccc is the crit cycle count which YottaDB increases by one every time it successfully grants the mutual exclusion (mutex) lock to a process. cccc provides a measure of the frequency of mutex lock use. MUTEXLCKALERT messages indicate that process pppp is blocking access to region rrrr for inappropriately long periods of time and thereby impacting performance for other processes needing access that region.

YottaDB produces this warning when:

- A process owning a critical section dies (most likely because of a kill -9) and the OS gives its PID to another process. To reclaim the inappropriately held critical section, YottaDB first checks whether the process is alive and whether it holds hold the critical section. On finding that the process is alive but does not hold the critical section, YottaDB concludes that it is not safe to free the critical section and alerts the operator with this message.

- The process holding the critical section is using a non-Isolated command such as ZSYSTEM, BREAK or a timed command in a way that creates a deadlock or a live-lock. YottaDB attempts to limit this by limiting the time a process using one of these commands can hold a critical section, but your use of non-Isolated commands and your settings for $ZMAXTPTIM and / or the environment variable $gtm_tpnotacidtime may be such that you set get MUTEXLCKALERT messages. Revise your settings for $gtm_tpnotacidtime and $ZMAXTPTIM appropriately.

- There is an IO bottleneck that caused YottaDB to slow down: YottaDB detects that process pppp is currently using the critical section lock.

Action: Monitor the system to determine whether there is a process with process id pppp and whether that process is a YottaDB process.

Implement a script to get a stack trace for process pppp or take other appropriate action and use the $gtm_procstuckexec environment variable to activate it before the block process sends the MUTEXLCKALERT message.

Identify and terminate process pppp to release control of that resource. If the process is a YottaDB process, use a MUPIP STOP to terminate it. If a process of another application, use an appropriate mechanism to stop it.

If this message is due to an IO bottleneck, adopt a strategy that reduces IO. Some of the IO reducing strategies are:

- Revisit your database configuration parameters (especially block size, number of global buffers, journal buffers, and so on) to see if you can make improvements.

- Create separate region (database) for temporary globals and do not replicate them.

- Consider whether a different database access method and journaling strategy could improve throughput while satisfying your operational needs.

- For application configurations with large numbers of concurrent processes and/or large process memory footprints, consider placing object code in shared libraries on YottaDB editions that support it. This may free system memory which the OS can use for its file system cache, or which you can use to increase the number of global buffers.

.. note::
    Do not apply IO reduction strategies all at once. Try them one at a time and always verify/measure the results of each strategy.

----------------------------
MUTEXRELEASED 
----------------------------

MUTEXRELEASED, Process xxxx [aaaa] has released the critical section for database yyyy to avoid deadlock. $TLEVEL: pppp t_tries: qqqq

Run Time Information: This indicates that YottaDB removed leftover system resource xxxx, used by the mutual exclusion subsystem. The resource was leftover due to abnormal termination of a YottaDB component.

Action: -

----------------------
MUTNWARN
----------------------

MUTNWARN, Database file xxxx has 0xaaa more transactions to go before reaching the transaction number limit (0xbbbb). Renew database with MUPIP INTEG TN_RESET.

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that MUPIP INTEG detected that the transaction numbers in the named database are approaching the maximum number as specified by the Maximum TN Warn field in the database file header. The actual maximum TN is less than this theoretical limit. DSE DUMP FILEHEADER shows what the limit is. The actual limit reflects some overhead used, for example, during a TN_RESET operation.

GDE Error: This indicates that a name was specified using : or , or ), which indicates a subscripted name, but the left parenthesis was missing.

Action: Specify a name with the appropriate left parenthesis.

----------------------
NAMNOTSTRSUBS
----------------------

NAMNOTSTRSUBS, Subscript #nnnn with value vvvv in name specification is not a properly formatted string subscript

GDE Error: This indicates that the nnnn'th subscript in a name did not have a valid string subscript. For example usages like GBL("AB"_) where the _ syntax is used to do concatenation of string subscripts but the right side of the _ operator is missing the string specification.

Action: Specify the name with a properly formatted string subscript.

---------------------
NAMNUMSUBSOFLOW
---------------------

NAMNUMSUBSOFLOW, Subscript #nnnn with value vvvv in name specification has a numeric overflow

GDE Error: This indicates that the nnnn'th subscript in a name specification includes a number that is too big to be represented in YottaDB.

Action: Specify a subscript with a number that is inside the numeric range supported by YottaDB.

---------------------
NAMONECOLON 
---------------------

NAMONECOLON, Subscripted Name specification nnnn must have at most one colon (range) specification

GDE Error: This indicates that a subscripted name was specified with a range specification using : in the last subscript but more than one colon character was used.

Action: Specify a range with only one colon.

--------------------
NAMRANGELASTSUB
--------------------

NAMRANGELASTSUB, Ranges in name specification nnnn are allowed only in the last subscript

GDE Error: This indicates that one or more ranges (using : syntax) were specified in a name somewhere other than the last subscript.

Action: Specify any ranges only in the last subscript of a name.

-------------------
NAMRANGEORDER
-------------------

NAMRANGEORDER, Range in name specification nnnn specifies out-of-order subscripts using collation sequence #cccc

GDE Error: This indicates that the range in the name specification is out-of-order. For example yy(10:1) specifies numeric subscripts that are not in order (10 is greater than 1 and so it should have been 1:10 instead). In case of string subscripts, the collation sequence cccc is used to arrive at the subscript representation in the database and this is what gets compared for the left and right ends of the range to determine if they are in order or not. For example yy("a":"g") is in order in case of collation sequence 0 (ascii ordering) but might not be in order if the name yy has a non-zero collation defined and that collation sorts strings in reverse ascii order.

Action: Specify ranges in order i.e. lower end of the range on the left hand side and the higher end of the range on the right hand side.

-----------------
NAMRANGEOVERLAP 
-----------------

NAMRANGEOVERLAP, Range in name specifications mmmm and nnnn overlap using collation sequence #cccc

GDE Error: This indicates that the subscripted name specifications mmmm and nnnn belong to the same unsubscripted global name and map to different regions but define ranges that overlap.

Action: Ranges that overlap cannot map to different regions. The only exception is sub-ranges where one range lies completely inside of another. Fix the range specifications to either map to the same region or split the ranges further to avoid overlap.

-------------------
NAMRPARENNOTEND
-------------------

NAMRPARENNOTEND, Subscripted Name specification nnnn cannot have anything following the right parenthesis at the end of subscripts

GDE Error: This indicates that a subscripted name was specified where the right parenthesis denoting the end of the subscripts was followed by more characters.

Action: Specify all subscripts of a name inside the left and right parenthesis that immediately follow the unsubscripted name.

--------------------
NAMSTARSUBSMIX 
--------------------

NAMSTARSUBSMIX, Name specification nnnn cannot contain * and subscripts at the same time

GDE Error: This indicates that the name nnnn contains both * and subscripts which is not allowed.

Action: Specify a wildcard (*) or subscripts, but not both.

-------------------
NAMSTARTBAD
-------------------

NAMSTARTBAD, xxxx must start with '%' or an alphabetic character

GDE Error: This indicates that an ADD or CHANGE command specified a name xxxx that does not begin with a '%' sign or an alphabetic character.

Action: Add a '%' sign or an alphabetic character to the beginning of the name.

----------------------
NAMSTRSUBSCHARG 
----------------------

NAMSTRSUBSCHARG, Subscript #nnnn with value vvvv in name specification specifies a $C/$ZCH with number cccc that is invalid in the current $zchset

GDE Error: This indicates that the nnnn'th subscript in a name specifies a string subscript using $CHAR/$ZCHAR but one of the arguments to this function (potentially in a comma-separated list) is invalid.

Action: An invalid integer argument is one which returns a null string when passed to $CHAR/$ZCHAR with the current $zchset setting. Specify the string subscript with a valid argument to $CHAR/$ZCHAR.

--------------------
NAMSTRSUBSCHINT 
--------------------

NAMSTRSUBSCHINT, Subscript #nnnn with value vvvv in name specification does not have a positive integer inside $C/$CHAR/$ZCH/$ZCHAR

GDE Error: This indicates that the nnnn'th subscript in a name specifies a string subscript using $CHAR/$ZCHAR but one of the arguments to this function (potentially in a comma-separated list) is not a positive integer.

Action: Specify the string subscript with a positive integer argument to $CHAR/$ZCHAR.

---------------------
NAMSTRSUBSFUN 
---------------------

NAMSTRSUBSFUN, Subscript #nnnn with value vvvv in name specification uses function other than $C/$CHAR/$ZCH/$ZCHAR

GDE Error: This indicates that the nnnn'th subscript in a name specifies a string subscript using an unsupported function. The only two supported functions are $CHAR or $ZCHAR (long form and short forms).

Action: Specify the string subscript using only the supported functions.

--------------------
NAMSUBSBAD 
--------------------

NAMSUBSBAD, Subscript #nnnn with value vvvv in name specification is an invalid number or string

GDE Error: This indicates that the nnnn'th subscript in a name specification is neither a valid number or a string.

Action: Specify a valid subscript.

--------------------
NAMSUBSEMPTY 
--------------------

NAMSUBSEMPTY, Subscript #nnnn is empty in name specification

GDE Error: This indicates that the nnnn'th subscript in a name specification is empty. For example the 2nd subscript in a(1,,3) is empty.

Action: Specify the subscripted name with a non-empty subscript.

-----------------
NCTCOLLDIFF 
-----------------

NCTCOLLDIFF, Source and destination for MERGE cannot have different numerical collation type

Run Time Error: This indicates that two arguments of the MERGE command have different numerical collation type.

Action: Use the %GBLDEF utility to set the same numerical collation type for both the arguments or use another method, such as a $ORDER() loop or MUPIP EXTRACT and LOAD to move the data.

--------------------
NCTCOLLSPGBL 
--------------------

NCTCOLLSPGBL, Database region rrrr contains portion of spanning global ^gggg and so cannot support non-zero numeric collation type

Run Time Error: This indicates that region rrrr contains parts of a global gggg that spans multiple regions according to the current global directory but the directory tree in rrrr indicates gggg has a non-zero numeric collation type.

Action: Spanning globals only support a value of zero for numeric collation (i.e. numbers collate as numbers, not as strings). Access region rrrr using a temporary global directory that maps all names (including gggg) to rrrr, extract the gggg global, KILL it, use $$set^%^GBLDEF to fix the numeric collation to 0, reload the global from the extract, switch back to the regular global directory. An alternative recovery action that does not require extract/load is to change the global directory so gggg is no longer a spanning global or has no mappings into any region that collates numbers using their string value.

----------------------
NEEDTRIGUPGRD
----------------------

NEEDTRIGUPGRD, Cannot do trigger operation on database file ffff until it is upgraded; Run MUPIP TRIGGER -UPGRADE first

Run Time Error: Upgrades from some versions to some more recent versions change aspects of the trigger definitions. This message indicates YottaDB encountered a trigger definition in an old format.

Action: Run MUPIP TRIGGER -UPGRADE. Alternatively, revert to the older version, use MUPIP TRIGGER or $ZTRIGGER() to select all triggers and save the result, delete all the triggers, return to the newer version and reinstall the triggers.

----------------------
NEGFRACPWR
----------------------

NEGFRACPWR, Invalid operation: fractional power of negative number

Run Time Error: This indicates that the power of an exponentiation operation is negative and contains a fractional portion. This type of operation produces an imaginary component in its result, and M does not specify such operations.

Action: Modify the code to prevent negative powers with fractional parts in exponentiation operations or trap the resulting errors.

---------------------
NESTFORMP 
---------------------

NESTFORMP, Formal parameter list cannot be combined with nested line

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a line included both a formallist and a nesting level-indicator (.).

Action: Parameter passing is incompatible with argumentless DO commands. Remove the formallist or the level-indicator and reorganize the routine, if appropriate.

-----------------------
NETDBOPNERR 
-----------------------

NETDBOPNERR, Error while attempting to open database across net

Run Time Error: This indicates that the YottaDB encountered an error when it attempted to open a database that is on a remote node served by a GT.CM server.

Action: Review subsequent message(s) to determine the nature of the problem.

----------------------
NETFAIL 
----------------------

NETFAIL, Failure of Net operation

Run Time Error: This indicates that a network failure occurred but it could not be traced to any current activity.

Action: If the problem persists, contact the group responsible for database operations on your network.

-----------------
NETLCKFAIL 
-----------------

NETLCKFAIL, Lock operation across Net failed

Run Time Error: This indicates that a LOCK, ZALLOCATE, or ZDEALLOCATE that involved a remote database failed.

Action: This network failure involves M LOCKs. Retry the operation from a point that establishes all necessary LOCKs. If the problem persists, contact the group responsible for database operations on your network.

--------------------
NEWJNLFILECREAT 
--------------------

NEWJNLFILECREAT, Journal file xxxx nearing maximum size. New journal file created.

Run Time/MUPIP Information: This indicates that YottaDB created a new journal file as it reached the maximum allowed journal size.

Action: Refer to the documentation on maximum allowed journal file size.

------------------
NLMISMATCHCALC
------------------

NLMISMATCHCALC, Location of xxxx expected at yyyy, but found at zzzz

Run Time Error: This indicates that the shared memory location of xxxx shows a layout problem. Typically, this is caused by attempting to use databases opened by a YottaDB version, different from the currently running version.

Action: Rundown the database and ensure a stable and consistent database configuration before attempting to use it again.

-------------------
NLRESTORE 
-------------------

NLRESTORE, DB file header field FFFF: VVVV does not match the value used in original mapping - restoring to: OOOO

DSE Warning: When DSE encounters a internal header field named FFFF whose value VVVV conflicts with the original value OOOO, DSE issues a warning message and uses the original value in order to successfully access shared memory.

Action: Please restore the header fields to their correct values. As a low level database repair tool of last resort, DSE assumes a knowledgeable user, and does no edit checking of input values. Do not use DSE to make routine changes, and do not use DSE to change a parameter if you can accomplish the same goal with MUPIP. As the normal system administration and operations tool, MUPIP has the ability to change parameters you might normally need to change, and it does check that input values are reasonable. Changing fileheader parameters with DSE should normally be performed with stand-alone access. Change fileheader parameters on an open database only under the guidance of an expert YottaDB support channel. 

-------------------
NOACTION 
-------------------

NOACTION, Not updating Global Directory xxxx

GDE Information: This indicates that GDE did not write a new version of existing Global Directory xxxx due to a QUIT or an EXIT when no changes had been made.

Action: GDE displays this message when you EXIT GDE without making any changes to the Global Directory. It also displays this message when you terminate a GDE session with the QUIT command. If you made changes you want to save, you must restart GDE , perform your work and save the changes before exiting GDE.

---------------------
NOALIASLIST 
---------------------

NOALIASLIST, Parenthetical lists of multiple arguments cannot have a preceding alias introducer or include alias (*) forms

Run Time Error: This indicates the argument for a SET command attempted to assign an alias using a parenthesized list as a left-hand argument, which is unsupported syntax.

Action: Correct the code in question to avoid the parenthesized list.

-----------------------
NOCANONICNAME 
-----------------------

NOCANONICNAME, Value is not a canonic name (xxxx).

Run Time Error: This indicates that the argument supplied to $QLENGTH, or the first argument to $QSUBSCRIPT is not a valid glvn.

Action: Pass valid argument to $QLENGHT/$QSUBSCRIPT

--------------
NOCCPPID 
--------------

NOCCPPID, Cannot find CCP process ID

CCE Error: This indicates that a CCE DUMP did not complete because it could not find a process with the name for the CCP.

Action: The CCP is not running properly on your node. Report this error to the group responsible for clustered databases at your site.

-----------------
NOCHLEFT 
-----------------

NOCHLEFT, Unhandled condition exception (all handlers exhausted) process terminating

Run Time Fatal: This indicates an internal error in handling of error conditions in YottaDB.

Action: Report the entire incident context with the complete operator log generated to your YottaDB support channel.

--------------------
NOCREMMBIJ 
--------------------

NOCREMMBIJ, MM access method not compatible with BEFORE image journaling; Database file DDDD not created

MUPIP/Run Time Error: While creating a database file with access mode MM, YottaDB found the database file DDDD to be configured for BEFORE image journaling which is not supported with that access method.

Action: Either change the access mode of the file or do not enable BEFORE image journaling and retry.

-----------------------
NOCRENETFILE
-----------------------

NOCRENETFILE, Database file DDDD not created; cannot create across network

All YottaDB Components Error: While creating a database with the AUTODB flag on, YottaDB discovered that the database is configured to be a remote GT.CM database. This configuration is not supported.

Action: Either change the file to be local or remove the AUTODB flag from the file description in the global directory and retry.

------------------------
NODFRALLOCSUPP
------------------------

NODFRALLOCSUPP, The NODEFER_ALLOCATE qualifier is not allowed on this operating system. Not changing the defer allocation flag

MUPIP Error: Indicates the disk space preallocation is not supported on the current operating system.

Action: Consider using an external utility, such as FALLOCATE, to fulfill the need. Currently, Linux and AIX are the supported operating systems for the NODEFER_ALLOCATE feature.

---------------------
NOEDITOR
---------------------

NOEDITOR, Can't find an executable editor: eeee

Run Time Error: The ZEDIT command cannot find an executable editor.

Action: Ensure that the EDITOR environment variable points to an editor that is executable by the user..

--------------------
NOENDIANCVT
--------------------

NOENDIANCVT, Unable to convert the endian format of file dddd due to eeee

MUPIP Error: One of the requirements for the MUPIP ENDIANCVT command was not met. The problems include: "database format is not the current version", "minor database format is not the current version", "some blocks are not upgraded to the current version", "kills in progress", "the database is frozen", "a GT.CM server accessing the database", "recovery was interrupted", "database creation in progress", "wc_blocked is set- rundown needed", "the database is corrupted".

Action: Resolve the reported conditions and repeat the command or use the -OVERRIDE qualifier if it is appropriate to bypass the error condition.

----------------------
NOEXCLUDE 
----------------------

NOEXCLUDE, None of the excluded variables exist

MUPIP Information: This indicates that MUPIP REORG did not find any of the variables specified in the EXCLUDE qualifier to be present in the database.

Action: Verify the names specified in the EXCLUDE qualifier in case you expected them to be present in the database file and not be reorged.

--------------------
NOEXCNOZTRAP
--------------------

NOEXCNOZTRAP, Neither an exception nor a Ztrap is specified

Run Time Warning: This indicates that a $CTRAP character arrived but no EXCEPTION or $ZTRAP existed to handle it.

Action: Determine why these circumstances coincide. This error never appears on a device; in this particular case, it is assigned to the image termination status as a warning.

-------------------
NOEXIT 
-------------------

NOEXIT, Cannot exit because of verification failure

GDE Information: This indicates that GDE encountered errors in the REGION-SEGMENT or SEGMENT-FILE mappings and cannot exit.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information. Verify the mappings and modify them as appropriate.

---------------------
NOFORKCORE
---------------------

NOFORKCORE, Unable to fork off process to create core. Core creation postponed.

Run Time Warning: This indicates that the process, which failed was unable to create a memory dump file, possibly due to lack of system resources.

Action: Reduce the number of users and stop any unnecessary processes.

----------------------
NOGTCMDB 
----------------------

NOGTCMDB, ffff does not support operation on GT.CM database region: rrrr

Utility Error: Facility ffff cannot perform the requested operation on a GT.CM database such as rrrr.

Action: Use the utility on the remote GT.CM server system or move the database so it is local rather than remote.

--------------------
NOJNL
--------------------

NOJNL, ssss segments do not support journaling.

MUPIP Error: This error indicates that the segment type ssss does not support journaling.

Action: For more information on Journaling, refer to the `Journaling chapter in the Administration and Operations Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/ydbjournal.html>`_.

--------------------
NOJNLPOOL 
--------------------

NOJNLPOOL, No journal pool info found in the replication instance of xxxx

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that YottaDB / MUPIP did not get replication information from the instance file specified. Replication instance file was not initialized because replication did not start, or some other process reset the replication instance file.

Action: Start the source server if it was not started. If the source server was running, stop the server and perform MUPIP RUNDOWN (if MUPIP RUNDOWN fails, try MUPIP RUNDOWN region * ).

--------------------------
NOLBRSRC
--------------------------

NOLBRSRC, Object libraries cannot have SRC paths associated

Run Time Error: This indicates that GTM$ROUTINES / gtmroutines or a SET $ZROUTINES attempted to place a source specification (SRC qualifier / source directory path) on an object library.

Action: Remove the source specification. YottaDB does not use the qualifier SRC= or source directories on object libraries. If you must provide access to sources corresponding to objects in the shared library, attach the source directory to an existing object directory entry. Since YottaDB does not support automatic recompilations into libraries, care must be taken when providing access to sources of library routines.

-----------------------
NOLOCKMATCH 
-----------------------

NOLOCKMATCH, No matching locks were found in rrrr

LKE Information: SHOW or CLEAR, found that no LOCKs match the specified criteria in region rrrr; note that specifying no search criteria acts like a wildcard, checking all LOCKs in the region.

Action: If this is not the expected result, check the search criteria and / or research the LOCK protocol to validate its correct operation.

----------------------
NOLOG 
----------------------

NOLOG, Logging is currently disabled. Log file is xxxx.

GDE Error: This indicates that GDE is not logging user activities.

Action: Use the LOG -ON command to turn on GDE logging.

-------------------
NOMORESEMCNT
-------------------

NOMORESEMCNT, SSSS counter semaphore has reached its maximum and stopped counting for database DDDD. Run MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -BACKWARD, MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER -BACKWARD or MUPIP RUNDOWN to restore the database files and shared resources to a clean state

All YottaDB Components Information: The counter semaphore reached its system-imposed limit so YottaDB no longer maintains the count. SSSS is either "access" or "ftok" signifying the particular counter type that stopped. DDDD is the database of the corresponding counter.

Action: YottaDB will not automatically shutdown the database. To clean the database file header and shared resources after the last process has exited the database file, do an explicit MUPIP -ROLLBACK -BACKWARD (for replicated database files), MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER -BACKWARD (for database files that are journaled but not replicated), or MUPIP RUNDOWN (for database files that are neither replicated nor journaled), on the database file DDDD.

-----------------
NONASCII
-----------------

NONASCII, ssss is illegal for a oooo as it contains non-ASCII characters

GDE Error: The specification ssss contains non-ASCII characters which are required for an object of type oooo.

Action: Chose an object name or value containing only ASCII characters.

-------------------
NONEGATE
-------------------

NONEGATE, Qualifier xxxx cannot be negated

GDE Error: This indicates that the qualifier does not support this usage.

Action: Review the `Administration and Operations Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/index.html>`_ or the `Programmer's Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/ProgrammersGuide/index.html>`_ for the correct usage.

-------------------
NONTPRESTART
-------------------

NONTPRESTART, Database dddd; code: cccc; blk: bbbb in glbl: ^gggg; blklvl: llll, type: tttt, zpos: pppp

Run Time Information: This is an informational message for non-TP transaction messages. The frequency of this message can be set by $gtm_nontprestart_log_delta and $gtm_nontprestart_log_first environment variables. dddd is the database the restart occurred; cccc is the code described in the `Maintaining Database Integrity chapter of the Administration and Operations Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/integrity.html>`_; bbbb is the block where YottaDB detected a concurrency conflict that caused the restart; gggg shows the global reference within that block; llll is the level of that block; tttt indicates the type of activity that detected the conflict; pppp is the source line where restart ocurred on.

Action: None required in most cases. If the messages are too frequent either investigate the processes that reference to that particular global and its block, or reduce the number of messages by tweaking $gtm_nontprestart_log_delta and $gtm_nontprestart_log_first environment variables.

--------------------
NONUTF8LOCALE
--------------------

NONUTF8LOCALE, Locale has character encoding (cccc) which is not compatible with UTF-8 character set

Run Time Error: This error is reported by YottaDB when it recognizes that the LC_CTYPE locale category cccc (as shown by the UNIX locale command) does not use UTF-8 character encoding when gtm_chset is "UTF-8".

Action: Set the environment variable LC_CTYPE to a Unicode locale name with UTF-8 character encoding. Note that LC_ALL, if defined, overrides LC_CTYPE. The name of the locale varies between different UNIX platforms, but mostly in the form of <lang>_<country>.<charset>, where each element (without the angular brackets) has the form shown below:

- <lang> is the language code in lower case (such as en, or de).
- <country> is the country name in upper case (such as US, GB)
- <charset> is the character set encoding (such as UTF-8, ISO8859-1)

Refer to the operating system manuals for the specific details of available locale names on the system.

-----------------
NOPERCENTY 
-----------------

NOPERCENTY, ^%Y* is a reserved global name in YottaDB

GDE Error: This indicates an attempt to map user values to YottaDB reserved space ^%Y*.

Action: Map application names to something other than ^%Y*.

---------------------
NOPINI 
---------------------

NOPINI, PINI journal record expected but not found in journal file xxxx at offset yyyy

MUPIP Error: This indicates that MUPIP did not encounter a valid and expected Process Initialization Record (PINI), at offset yyyy of the journal file xxxx.

Action: Run MUPIP JOURNAL EXTRACT -FULL DETAIL FORWARD FENCE=NONE NOERROR_LIMIT xxxx. Report the entire incident context with the appropriate extract file and error message(s) to your YottaDB support channel.

-------------------
NOPLACE 
-------------------

NOPLACE, Line specified in a ZBREAK cannot be found

Run Time Warning: This indicates that the ZBREAK was ignored because it specified a line that could not be found in the image.

Action: Modify the ZBREAK or ZLINK the routine that has the missing label.

--------------------
NOPREVLINK 
--------------------

NOPREVLINK, Journal file xxxx has a null previous link

MUPIP Error: This indicates that MUPIP found the previous link of journal file xxxx to be null, when it needed to process backward beyond the journal files first record.

Action: Verify the specified resync or time qualifiers are as intended. If correct values were specified, and null link was due to operator action, restore the journal generation link and reissue the command.

--------------------
NOPRINCIO
--------------------

NOPRINCIO, NOPRINCIO Unable to write to principal device

Run Time Fatal: This indicates that YottaDB attempted to, but could not, READ from, or WRITE to, the principal device and therefore attempted to issue an appropriate error, for example, an IOEOF. However if the error handling does not prevent any and all subsequent READs and WRITEs to the no longer available principal device, the next subsequent I/O error shuts down the process immediately with a NOPRINCIO to prevent mysteriously lost output, or, worse, an indefinite loop.

Action: The NOPRINCIO error message is FATAL which does not drive device or trap handlers and terminates the process. This termination does not allow any application level orderly shutdown and, depending on the application may lead to out-of-design application state. Therefore, YottaDB recommends appropriate application level error handling that recognizes the preceding error and performs an orderly shutdown without issuing any additional READ or WRITE to the principal device. The most common causes for the principal device to cease to exist involve terminal sessions or socket connections (including those from processes started by inetd/xinetd). When the remote client terminates the connection, the underlying principal device becomes inaccessible making any subsequent attempt to READ from, or WRITE to it hopeless. In the case of terminals, a user closing the window of a session without cleanly exiting from the YottaDB process sets up the case that can drive this error. 

--------------------
NORECVPOOL
--------------------

NORECVPOOL, No receiver pool info found in the replication instance of xxxx

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that YottaDB / MUPIP did not get replication information from the instance file specified. Replication instance file was not initialized because receiver server did not start or, some other process reset the replication instance file.

Action: Start the receiver server if the server was not started. If the receiver server was running, stop the server and perform MUPIP RUNDOWN (if MUPIP RUNDOWN fails, try MUPIP RUNDOWN region * ).

---------------------
NOREGION 
---------------------

NOREGION, REGION not found: xxxx

LKE Error: This indicates that a SHOW or CLEAR command with the qualifier REGION=xxxx could not locate region xxxx in the current Global Directory.

Action: Look for and correct any typographical errors in the region name. Use GDE to look in the Global Directory for names of defined regions.

-------------------------
NOREPLCTDREG 
-------------------------

NOREPLCTDREG, Replication subsystem found no region replicated for dddd ffff

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that the replication system is present, but no globals are configured for replication in ffff where dddd is "instance file" for UNIX.

Action: Use MUPIP SET to specify which database regions to replicate.

---------------------
NORESYNCSUPPLONLY 
---------------------

NORESYNCSUPPLONLY, NORESYNC only supported for Supplementary Instances

Receiver Server log/MUPIP Error: Issued by a Receiver Server on a non-Supplementary Instance when it is started with a -NORESYNC; -NORESYNC only applies to Supplementary Instances started with -UPDOK, not to non-Supplementary Instances.

Action: Use this qualifier only in a valid context.

----------------------
NORESYNCUPDATERONLY 
----------------------

NORESYNCUPDATERONLY, NORESYNC qualifier only allowed on a Supplementary Instance which allows local updates

Receiver Server log/MUPIP Error: Issued by a Receiver Server when started with -NORESYNC on a Supplementary Instance but started without -UPDOK; -NORESYNC applies only to Supplementary Instances started with -UPDOK.

Action: Use this qualifier only in a valid context.

-------------------
NOSELECT
-------------------

NOSELECT, None of the selected variables exist, halting

MUPIP Information: This indicates that a MUPIP EXTRACT or REORG operation did not occur because the global variables specified by the SELECT= qualifier do not exist.

Action: Look for an inappropriate definition for GTM$GBLDIR / gtmgbldir or typographical errors in the specified variables.

-------------------
NOSOCKETINDEV 
-------------------

NOSOCKETINDEV, There is no socket in the current socket device

Run Time Error: This indicates that either no sockets have been established for the device or that all the sockets attached to the device have been closed prior to the current command.

Action: Review the logic managing the sockets and correct it.

---------------------
NOSOCKHANDLE 
---------------------

NOSOCKHANDLE, No socket handle specified in WRITE /PASS

Run Time Error: WRITE /PASS was called without specifying at least one socket handle to pass.

Action: Make sure the code is specifying at least one socket handle.

----------------
NOSPACECRE 
----------------

NOSPACECRE, Not enough space to create database file xxxx. aaaa blocks are needed, only bbbb available.

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the requested file was not created because the file system did not have sufficient space.

Action: Check the allocation size specified in the global directory. Choose another location or reconfigure the file system or volume.

----------------
NOSPACEEXT
----------------

NOSPACEEXT, Not enough disk space for file xxxx to extend. aaaa blocks needed. bbbb blocks available.

Run Time Error: This indicates that there is not adequate space to do a needed journal file extension of the currently specified extension size of aaaa. If the Instance Freeze mechanism is active, YottaDB modifies the NOSPACEEXT message from error (-E-) to warning (-W-) to indicate it is performing the extension even though the available space is less than the specified extension amount. 

Action: Locate appropriate disk space and adjust the journal file path. To reestablish durability, perform a MUPIP BACKUP that turns journaling on again.

--------------
NOSTARFILE
--------------

NOSTARFILE, Only star(*) argument can be specified with xxxx

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the qualifier xxxx, specified with the MUPIP JOURNAL command allows only star (*) as an argument.

Action: Specify star (*) as an argument instead of explicit journal file names.

------------------
NOSUBSCRIPT 
------------------

NOSUBSCRIPT, No such subscript found (xxxx)

Run Time Error: This indicates that the second argument to $QSUBSCRIPT is less than -1.

Action: Pass a value greater than -1 as the second argument to $QS.

-----------------
NOSUCHPROC
-----------------

NOSUCHPROC, Process xxxx does not exist no need to yyyy it

Run Time Information: This indicates the specified process xxxx does not exist, to which an attempt to signal yyyy was made. This may occur in normal operation, but is reported to the operator logging facility in case an abnormal situation needs to be studied.

Action: -

-------------------
NOSUPPLSUPPL
-------------------

NOSUPPLSUPPL, Instance ssss is configured to perform local updates, so it cannot receive from Supplementary Instance iiii

Receiver Server log/MUPIP Error: Issued by a Receiver Server or a MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -FETCHRESYNC on a Supplementary Instance ssss started with -UPDOK attempted to connect to instance iiii, but found IIII is also a Supplementary Instance. A Supplementary Instance that permits local updates can only replicate updates that originate on a non-Supplementary Instance.

Action: Reconfigure the instances to a supported configuration.

-------------------
NOTALLDBOPN
-------------------

NOTALLDBOPN, Not all required database files were opened

MUPIP Fatal: This indicates that all databases needed for replication could not be opened; the server will not start.

Operator log Warning: A process needed to do a database write while holding a critical resource, but an Online Freeze was in place without AutoRelease enabled. No other process will be able to acquire the critical resource until the Online Freeze is removed.

Action: MUPIP FREEZE -OFF will remove the freeze and allow the process to continue, at which time it will send a OFRZCRITREL message to the operator log. This situation can be avoided by specifying MUPIP FREEZE -ON -ONLINE without the -NOAUTORELEASE option, or by including the -AUTORELEASE option.

------------------
OFRZNOTHELD 
------------------

OFRZNOTHELD, Online Freeze had been automatically released for at least one region

MUPIP Warning: A MUPIP FREEZE -OFF command encountered at least one region which previously had an Online Freeze, but a process had AutoReleased it.

Action: The command cleaned up the region with the AutoReleased Online Freeze, and database operations are back to normal. However, any database file snapshots or copies made after the Online Freeze should be discarded, as processes likely will have written to the file since the AutoRelease. An OFRZAUTOREL message in the operator log will report which process performed the AutoRelease.

------------------

PRIMARYNOTROOT, Attempted operation not valid on non-root primary instance xxxx

MUPIP Error: If a replication instance is not a root primary (the journal pool already exists and was created by a source server command that specified propagateprimary), issuing a source server command with the start or deactivate qualifiers that has the rootprimary qualifier explicitly specified (or implicitly assumed) on this instance will cause this error to be issued. This error can also be issued by the receiver server or mupip rollback if the instance that the source server is running on is not a root primary and it connects to a receiver server or a mupip journal -rollback -fetchresync running on an instance that was formerly a root primary and has not yet had a mupip replic -source -losttncomplete command run either explicitly or implicitly on it.

Action: Use propagateprimary qualifier instead of rootprimary in the source server command. If this error is issued by the receiver server or fetchresync rollback, the secondary instance has to be brought up as the secondary of a root primary since it was a root primary immediately before this. The rule is that any instance that was previously a root primary should be brought up as a secondary of the new root primary. This will create a lost transaction file that needs to be applied on the new root primary. Once that is done, a mupip replic -source -losttncomplete command should be run either explicitly or implicitly on this instance before trying to bring this up as a secondary of a propagating primary.

--------------------
PROCTERM 
--------------------

PROCTERM, uuuu process termination due to cccc from eeee

Utility Warning: A utility uuuu, typically MUPIP, executing application code, possibly from a trigger, encountered a command cccc to terminate at $zposition location pppp.

Action: It is not typically wholesome for MUPIP to terminate this way - review your error handling and trigger definitions for a possible bug or misfeature.

---------------------
PROTNOTSUP 
---------------------

PROTNOTSUP, Protocol xxxx not supported

Run Time Error: This indicates that the protocol specified on the CONNECT or LISTEN deviceparameters is not currently supported.

Action: Use TCP/IP domain sockets by specifying TCP for the protocol string or LOCAL (aka UNIX) domain sockets by specifying LOCAL.

-------------------
QUALBAD
-------------------

QUALBAD, xxxx is not a valid qualifier

GDE Error: This indicates that GDE encountered a command with an invalid qualifier xxxx.

Action: Look for and correct typographical errors in the qualifier.

---------------
QUALDUP 
---------------

QUALDUP, xxxx qualifier appears more than once in the list

GDE Error: This indicates that GDE encountered the qualifier xxxx more than once in the command.

Action: Specify the qualifier only once in the list.

-----------------
QUALEXP 
-----------------

QUALEXP, Qualifier expected but not found

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ZROUTINES function did not encounter a qualifier, which is the next valid syntax element.

Action: Look for a missing right parenthesis or extra left parenthesis in a source directory specification.

---------------
QUALREQD 
---------------

QUALREQD, xxxx required

GDE Error: This indicates that a command was missing the required xxxx qualifier.

Action: Enter the missing qualifier.

--------------
QUALVAL
--------------

QUALVAL, Qualifier value required but not found

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ZROUTINES function did not specify a value for the SRC qualifier.

Action: The SRC qualifier requires a value.

------------------
QUITALSINV 
------------------

QUITALSINV, QUIT * return when the extrinsic was not invoked with SET *

Run Time Error: A [sub-]routine tried to pass an alias back to the caller, but the routine was not invoked to accept an alias return.

Action: Rework either the invocation or the return, or troubleshoot why the inappropriate invocation occurred. If the routine should conditionally return an alias, use $QUIT to select the proper type of return.

-------------------
QUITARGLST
-------------------

QUITARGLST, Quit cannot take a list of arguments

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a QUIT specified multiple arguments; M accepts only one argument.

Action: Look for a missing space after the QUIT or a typographical error. Modify the QUIT argument so that it consists of a single expression.

-------------------
QUITARGREQD 
-------------------

QUITARGREQD, Quit from an extrinsic must have an argument

Run Time Error: This indicates that a QUIT did not specify an argument but it corresponded to an invocation by an extrinsic function or special variable.

Action: Review the interface between the extrinsic and the invoked routine. Modify the QUIT or the invocation.

--------------------
QUITARGUSE 
--------------------

QUITARGUSE, Quit cannot take an argument in this context

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a QUIT in the scope of a FOR command specified an argument.

Action: Look for a missing space after the QUIT.

---------------------
RANDARGNEG
---------------------

RANDARGNEG, Random number generator argument must be greater than or equal to one

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $RANDOM function specified a zero or a negative argument.

Action: Look for the source of the argument. If you want to generate a 0 or 1 result, the argument should be 2 because a seed of 1 always produces the less-than-random result of 0.

--------------------
RAWDEVUNSUP 
--------------------

RAWDEVUNSUP, RAW device for region RRRR is not supported

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates an attempt to configure a raw device database. This is no longer supported.

Action: Create the database in a regular filesystem.

---------------------
RBWRNNOTCHG 
---------------------

RBWRNNOTCHG, Not all specified databases were changed

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that the MUPIP SET command did not include a value for the RESERVED_BYTES qualifier, or, the value specified was out of permissible range. Therefore, it did not modify the specified database.

Action: Verify the RESERVED_BYTES qualifier specification.

-------------------
RCVR2MANY 
-------------------

Last used version: V5.5-000

RCVR2MANY, The instance already has the maximum supportable number of receiver servers nnnn active

MUPIP Error: Issued by a Receiver Server on a Supplementary Instance (started with -UPDOK) which found it exceeds nnnn, the currently permitted number of Receiver Servers.

Action: Reconfigure the instances to a supported configuration.

-------------------
RCVRMANYSTRMS 
-------------------

RCVRMANYSTRMS, Receiver server now connecting to source stream NNNN but had previously connected to a different stream nnnn

Receiver Server log/MUPIP Error: Issued by a Receiver Server on a Supplementary Instance (started with -UPDOK) which had formerly connected to a source server corresponding to non-Supplementary stream nnnn, later disconnected and on reconnection found the Source Server corresponds to a different non-Supplementary stream NNNN.

Action: Mixing of non-Supplementary streams are not allowed in the same Receiver Server process. Restart the Receiver Server.

---------------------
RDFLTOOLONG
---------------------

RDFLTOOLONG, Length specified for fixed length read exceeds the maximum string size

Run Time Error: The size specified in the fixed length READ is too large. It should not exceed 1048576, which is the maximum string size supported by YottaDB.

Action: Modify the READ to specify a length less than or equal to 1048576.

-----------------------
RDFLTOOSHORT
-----------------------

RDFLTOOSHORT, Length specified for fixed length read less than or equal to zero

Run Time Error: This indicates that a READ fixed length (#) specified a value of less than one.

Action: Change the length (i.e., the portion of the READ argument that appears after the delimiter (#)) to a valid value, or add a postconditional to the READ command to suppress the length when it is less than or equal to zero.

-------------------------
READONLYNOBG
-------------------------

READONLYNOBG, Read-only cannot be enabled on non-MM databases

MUPIP Error: This indicates an attempt to change a BG database to -READ_ONLY or to change a -READ_ONLY to MM access method; -READ_ONLY only compatible with the MM access mode.

Action: Verify whether the database should not be read only and adjust, if appropriate. Alternatively, set the database to MM access mode then mark it as read-only.

-------------------------
REC2BIG
-------------------------

REC2BIG, Record size (xxxx) is greater than maximum (yyyy) for region: zzzz

Run Time Error: This indicates that a SET attempted to create a database node with a combined length of keys and data (xxxx) that exceeds the maximum length yyyy permitted for region zzzz.

Action: Use smaller data records or keys in the program. If you want to enlarge the record size for the region, use GDE to change the Global Directory and recreate the database with MUPIP CREATE. If it is necessary to permit the data without allowing time to rebuild the database, use MUPIP CHANGE -RECORD_SIZE. Be careful when you increase the size for existing databases; use GDE to ensure that they have proper characteristics the next time they are CREATEd.

----------------------
RECCNT 
----------------------

RECCNT, Last LOAD record number: xxxx

MUPIP Information: EXTRACT and LOAD use this message to display xxxx, the total number of records processed.

Action: -

---------------------
RECLOAD
---------------------

RECLOAD, Error loading record number: nnnn

MUPIP Error: This message identifies a record nnnn that MUPIP could not LOAD and follows a message about the cause. If this message is Fatal, which it can be for BIN format, it produces a core file for diagnostic analysis.

Action: Address the cause or, for GO and ZWR format input files, examine the record with a text editor for possible correction or alternate action and for BIN format if fixing the cause does not resolve the error switch to ZWR format EXTRACT.

--------------------
RECNOCREJNL
--------------------

Last used version: V4.3-001F

RECNOCREJNL, Recover could not create new journal file xxxx.

Run Time Error: This message is generated when recover/rollback fails to create the temporary forw_phase journal file. The database is restored to a consistent state with some earlier time, but recovery to the specific time could not be performed.

Action: Review the accompanying messages for additional information. Refer to the `Maintaining Database Integrity chapter in the Administration and Operations Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/integrity.html>`_.

---------------------
RECORDSTAT 
---------------------

RECORDSTAT, gggg: Key cnt: kkkk max subsc len: ssss max rec len: dddd max node len: rrrr

MUPIP Information: LOAD and EXTRACT use this to report on some characteristics of the global variables they processed, where gggg is an unsubscripted global name (region name appears in parentheses if gggg spans multiple regions), kkkk is the number of unique data cells in the array, ssss is the maximum subscripted key length, dddd is the maximum data length and rrrr is the maximum combined length of keys and subscripts.

Action: Use the information as appropriate.

---------------------
RECSIZENOTEVEN 
---------------------

RECSIZENOTEVEN, RECORDSIZE [xxxx] needs to be a multiple of 2 if ICHSET or OCHSET is UTF-16, UTF-16LE or UTF-16BE

Run Time Error: This error is issued when the OPEN command specifies an ICHSET or OCHSET or CHSET of UTF-16 or UTF-16LE or UTF-16BE and the RECORDSIZE specified (xxxx) is not a multiple of 2.

Action: Specify a RECORDSIZE that is a multiple of 2. 

-------------------
RECSIZIS 
-------------------

RECSIZIS, Record size is xxxx

GDE Information: This message displays the record size of the REGION with which you are working.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information.

-----------------
RECTOOBIG
-----------------

RECTOOBIG, Block size xxxx and yyyy reserved bytes limit record size to zzzz

GDE Warning: This indicates that an ADD, CHANGE, or TEMPLATE command specified a value for the qualifier RECORDSIZE that is incompatible with the value of xxxx specified for BLOCKSIZE. zzzz is the maximum RECORDSIZE supported by this BLOCKSIZE, and yyyy RESERVED_BYTES for the block. GDE displays this message with other error messages, including one that reports the specified record size.

Action: Modify the RECORDSIZE, BLOCKSIZE and/or RESERVED_BYTES, so they are compatible.

-----------------
RECVPOOLSETUP
-----------------

RECVPOOLSETUP, Receive Pool setup error

Run Time Error: This indicates that an error occurred in the replication subsystem while initializing the receive pool.

Action: Verify that the receiver server has been configured correctly. See accompanying messages for more information about the cause of this error.

---------------------
REGFILENOTFOUND 
---------------------

REGFILENOTFOUND, Database file DDDD corresponding to region RRRR cannot be found

MUPIP Error: This indicates MUPIP cannot locate the database file DDDD mapped to region RRRR.

Action: Ensure that the current global directory is the one intended that that it maps the file intended. If the path is relative or includes environment variables, ensure that the current working directory and any enironment variable are appropriate. Also ensure the file exists and has authorizations, including its path, that make it available to the user attempting to access it.

--------------------
REGIS 
--------------------

REGIS, in region xxxx

GDE Information: This message displays the name of the REGION with which you are working.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information.

---------------------

---------------------

REGNTFND, Region referenced not initialized

GT.CM Error: This indicates that there has been a region management error. The region may not be present, or there may have been an error during initialization.

Action: Record any accompanying messages and if necessary report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel.

-------------------
REGOPENFAIL
-------------------

REGOPENFAIL, Failed to open region rrrr (dddd) due to conflicting database shutdown activity

DSE/LKE Error: Another process or processes repeatedly removed shared memory right after each one of the interlocking bypass. As a result of this, LKE/DSE failed to initialize region rrrr (database for dddd)

Action: Identify the process or processes that causes LKE/DSE to bypass interlocking mechanism by holding semaphore(s). To do that, follow RESRCINTRLCKBYPAS messages. They should tell you the PID of the process currently holding the semaphore. Check that process to see if it is stuck. If it is not stuck or has already terminated, it is likely that the database is being closed and opened abnormally fast. You may try running LKE/DSE again to achieve successful initialization.

---------------------
REGOPENRETRY
---------------------

REGOPENRETRY, Attempt to open region rrrr (dddd) using startup shortcut failed due to conflicting database shutdown. Retrying...

DSE/LKE Information: Another process removed shared memory right after the interlocking bypass, so LKE/DSE could not attach to the shared memory of region rrrr (database dddd). LKE/DSE is repeating database initialization for database file dddd.

Action: None necessary.

---------------------
REGSSFAIL 
---------------------

REGSSFAIL, Process pppp encountered error contributing to the snapshot for region rrrr - the snapshot is no longer valid.

MUPIP Error: A YottaDB process encountered failure while opening snapshot file or attaching to shared memory or writing a block to the snapshot file, any of which invalidate the snapshot file. The original error should be in the operator log.

Action: Examine the operator log for messages issued by process pppp to obtain details of the failure and take action, possibly by modifying file access characteristics or user roles, to address the problem.

----------------------
RELINKCTLERR 
----------------------

RELINKCTLERR, Error with relink control structure for $ZROUTINES directory dddd

Run Time Error: Indicates a problem accessing a relink control file in the temporary directory typically specified by the gtm_linktmpdir environment variable.

Action: Use the accompanying message(s) for a detailed error status to diagnose and address the access issue.

---------------------
RELINKCTLFULL 
---------------------

RELINKCTLFULL, Relinkctl file for directory dddd is full (maximum entries mmmm)

Run Time Error: A process using directory dddd for initiated an auto-relink action with ZLINK or ZRUPDATE, or an autolink check with DO, GOTO, ZBREAK, ZGOTO, ZPRINT or $TEXT() which required adding information for the routine in question to the relinkctl file for directory dddd, but that relinkctl file was full with mmmm entries.

Action: Shut down all processes accessing the relinkctl file and issue MUPIP RUNDOWN -RELINKCTL dddd to cleanup the relinkctl file of potentially unused entries. Additionally, reduce the number of objects in the directory, typically by adding an additional object directory. 

----------------------
REMOTEDBNOSPGBL
----------------------

REMOTEDBNOSPGBL, Database region rrrr contains portion of a spanning global and so cannot point to a remote file

Run Time Error: This indicates that region rrrr of the current global directory contains parts of a spanning global and therefore cannot point to a remote database file.

Action: Fix the global directory file so region rrrr points to a local file or remove the global nodes that span into this region.

---------------------
REMOTEDBNOTRIG
---------------------

REMOTEDBNOTRIG, Trigger operations on global gggg not supported as it maps to database region rrrr that points to a remote file

MUPIP/Run Time Error: $ZTRIGGER() or MUPIP TRIGGER attempted to add, delete or modify a trigger in global gggg mapped to database region rrrr, which is defined as a GT.CM remote region, but GT.CM does not support trigger update actions.

Action: If you have a need for triggers on that globals in that region, log on to the remote instance in order to perform trigger maintenance.

--------------------
RENAMEFAIL 
--------------------

RENAMEFAIL, Rename of file xxxx to yyyy failed

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that MUPIP failed in its attempt to rename the existing file xxxx to yyyy, before creating the new xxxx file.

Action: Check the accompanying message(s) for additional information.

------------------
REORGCTRLY 
------------------

REORGCTRLY, User interrupt encountered during database reorg -- halting

MUPIP Information: This indicates that a REORG was interrupted. The reorganization is incomplete but the database is intact with no loss of data.

Action: Initiate REORG with RESUME qualifier, if appropriate.

-------------------
REORGINC 
-------------------

REORGINC, Reorg was incomplete. Not all globals were reorged.

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that MUPIP did not reorg all the globals because of some resource constraint errors.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for more information.

------------------
REPL2OLD 
------------------

REPL2OLD, Instance IIII uses a YottaDB version that does not support connection with the current version on iiii.

MUPIP Error: Issued by a Source Server, Receiver Server or MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -FETCHRESYNC on Instance iiii attempted to connect to instance IIII, but found IIII is running an earlier version that does not support the current replication protocol. This can indicate either that the older version is just too old for any connection with the newer version, or that the older version doesn't have the logic required to support a Supplementary Instance. 

Action: Upgrade the YottaDB version on IIII to a version that can support communication with the current version or, if this is a Supplementary Instance, that can deal with a Supplementary Instance or choose another appropriate instance for the connection.

---------------------
REPLACCSEM 
---------------------

REPLACCSEM, Error with replication access semaphore (id = xxxx) for instance file aaaa

MUPIP Error: This indicates problem with the semaphore xxxx associated with the instance designated by aaaa.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for details.

---------------------
REPLBRKNTRANS
---------------------

REPLBRKNTRANS, Replication subsystem found transaction xxxx broken or missing in the journal files

MUPIP Error: This indicates that while attempting to read the transaction with journal sequence number xxxx from journal files, the source server could not find all (or any) journal records belonging to that transaction.

Action: Restore the journal generation links, and/or the journal files. Deactivate and activate the source server (or shutdown and restart the source server). If the journal files that are needed are no longer available, follow the procedure Restoring secondary from backup of Primary detailed in the `Replication chapter of Administration and Operations Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/dbrepl.html>`_.

-----------------------
REPLCOMM 
-----------------------

REPLCOMM, Replication subsystem communication failure

MUPIP Error: This is a generic error indicating that there has been a communication error between the two systems performing replication.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for more information about the cause of this error.

----------------------
REPLERR 
----------------------

REPLERR, XXXX

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that YottaDB is performing tasks that may result in an error.

Action: Review accompanying messages for more information about why YottaDB generated this message.

--------------------
REPLEXITERR 
--------------------

Action: Review accompanying message(s) for more information.

--------------------
REPLFILIOERR
--------------------

REPLFILIOERR, Replication subsystem file I/O error xxxx

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the system was unable to perform an I/O operation on a file on the replication primary server. The accompanying message also tells whether there was a read error or a write error and names the file on which the error occurred.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for more information about the cause of this error.

---------------------
REPLFILTER 
---------------------

REPLFILTER, Replication filter subsystem failure

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the replication filter subsystem failed to start the application filter.

Action: In order to restart the filter subsystem, it is necessary to shut down the replication server and restart. If this error continues to appear, report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel.

------------------------
REPLFTOKSEM
------------------------

REPLFTOKSEM, Error with replication semaphores for instance file xxxx

MUPIP Error: This indicates that MUPIP could not create semaphore for replication instance file.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for more information.


--------------------------
REPLGBL2LONG 
--------------------------

REPLGBL2LONG, Global names longer than 8 characters cannot be handled at the secondary

Source Server log Error: A journal record contains a global variable name longer than 8 characters and the version running at the secondary does not support global variables longer than 8 characters.

Action: Upgrade the secondary to V5.0-FT01 or later. If upgrade is not possible, avoid replicating regions that contain globals longer than 8 characters.

--------------------------
REPLINFO 
--------------------------

REPLINFO, xxxx

Run Time Information: The information is contained in the message.

Action: -

--------------------
REPLINSTACC 
--------------------

REPLINSTACC, Error accessing replication instance file xxxx

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that some errors were encountered while accessing the specified replication instance file defined by $gtm_repl_instance or the relevant global directory.

Action: Refer to the accompanying message(s) for additional information.

--------------
REPLINSTCLOSE 
--------------

REPLINSTCLOSE, Error closing replication instance file xxxx

Run Time Error: There was an error when YottaDB or MUPIP tried to close the replication instance file. The error detail accompanies this message.

Action: Look at the accompanying error detail. Possible causes are file permissions, system quotas, etc. Fix the cause if possible. If not, report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel for further analysis.

--------------------
REPLINSTCREATE
--------------------

REPLINSTCREATE, Error creating replication instance file xxxx

Run Time Error: There was an error when YottaDB or MUPIP tried to create the replication instance file. The error detail accompanies this message.

Action: Look at the accompanying message that gives error details. Possible causes are file permissions, system quotas, and so on.  If possible, correct the cause and retry creating the replication instance file. If the error persists, report to your YottaDB support channel along with the error details.

---------------------
REPLINSTDBMATCH
---------------------

REPLINSTDBMATCH, Replication instance file xxxx has seqno xxxx while database has a different seqno yyyy

MUPIP Error: This error is issued by the first source server that is started on a replication instance or a mupip journal -rollback command if the journal sequence numbers stored in the instance file does not match that stored in the database file header. This is possible if the database was recreated or refreshed from a backup on another instance without correspondingly recreating the instance file.

Action: If this instance is not the root primary, this error can be handled by restoring both the database and the instance file from a previous backup (consistent backup of the instance file AND database files taken together at the same time) and restarting the instance. Subsequent to such a restore, all transactions since the last backup will be sent across from this instance's primary. Alternatively, this can be handled by shipping a copy of the database from any other instance (either the primary or any other secondary/tertiary), recreating the instance file and starting this instance as a secondary with the -updateresync qualifier. In either case, this procedure has to be repeated on all tertiary instances etc. that descend from this instance ensuring that for every primary-secondary instance pair, the secondary is not ahead of the primary in terms of journal sequence number. If this instance is the root primary, restoring from a prior backup may not be viable as it may mean loss of transactions that occurred after the backup. The alternative way to handle this error is to recreate the instance file on the root primary, ship a copy of the database from the primary and recreate instance files on ALL secondaries (tertiaries etc.) and restart the secondaries with the -updateresync qualifier. In addition, report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel.

-------------------------
REPLINSTDBSTRM 
-------------------------

REPLINSTDBSTRM, Replication instance file rrrr has seqno xxxx for Stream nnnn while database has a different seqno XXXX

MUPIP Error: Issued by the first source server started on a supplementary instance if the journal stream sequence numbers (for any non-supplementary stream from 0 through 15) stored in the instance file do not match those stored in the database file headers. This is possible if a database was recreated or refreshed from a backup on another instance without correspondingly recreating the instance file.

Action: If the database file is known to be accurate, recreate the instance file. If not, reinitialize this instance from a backup of some other instance in the same LMS Group (see Action section of REPLINSTDBMATCH error for more details on this).

------------------------
REPLINSTFMT
------------------------

REPLINSTFMT, Format error encountered while reading replication instance file xxxx. Expected yyyy. Found zzzz.

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This error is issued by YottaDB or MUPIP whenever it tries to open the replication instance file and finds that it was created with a format that the current version of YottaDB cannot interpret. YottaDB also produces this error when it encounters:

- an instance file created on a different endian system or
- an instance file created by a 32-bit (or 64-bit) version of YottaDB that is different from the current 64-bit (or 32-bit) version of YottaDB.

Action: Recreate the instance file using the mupip replic -instance_create command with the current version of YottaDB.

Action: If the error is issued by YottaDB review the accompanying message(s) in the operator log.

If a MUPIP SET -JOUNAL=ON command produces this message for the region in the operator log, it may indicate that one or more of the current generation journal files are damaged/missing and new journal files were created with no back pointers to the previous journal files. YottaDB LLC recommends taking a database backup at the earliest convenience because a MUPIP RECOVER/ROLLBACK will not be able to go back past xxxx. If this message is for a specified region(s), consider switching the journal files for all regions (with REGION "*") that the process has opened (all journaled/replicated regions in the instance if replication is in use) to ensure that the RECOVER/ROLLBACK for other regions remains unaffected.

No action is required if the MUPIP BACKUP -NEWJNLFILES=NOPREVLINK issues the error. 

---------------------
REPLINSTFREEZECOMMENT
---------------------

REPLINSTFREEZECOMMENT, Freeze Comment: xxxx

Run Time Information: This message contains details about a freeze on a replication instance. The instance information is included in an associated REPLINSTFROZEN message. In the case of an automatic freeze, xxxx identifies an error that triggered the freeze. In the case of an administrative freeze, xxxx contains the text provided by MUPIP REPLICATE -SOURCE -FREEZE=ON -COMMENT="xxxx".

Action: Refer to REPLINSTFROZEN.

---------------------
REPLINSTFROZEN 
---------------------

REPLINSTFROZEN, Instance xxxx is now Frozen

Run Time Error: This indicates that the replication instance xxxx is frozen due to a custom error or an out-of-space condition on a region with INST_FREEZE_ON_ERROR set, or by an administrator with the MUPIP REPLICATE -SOURCE -FREEZE=ON command. Updates to database files or shared memory for regions in the instance are blocked.

Action: Check the associated REPLINSTFREEZECOMMENT message for details on the cause of the freeze. For out-of-space conditions, make sufficient disk space available to remove the freeze. For custom errors or for administrative freezes, MUPIP REPLICATE -SOURCE -FREEZE=OFF or a system restart removes the freeze.

--------------------
REPLINSTMISMTCH
--------------------

REPLINSTMISMTCH, Process has replication instance file ffff (jnlpool shmid = ssss) open but database dddd is bound to instance file gggg (jnlpool shmid =tttt)

Run Time Error: The process attempted an update on the replicated database dddd associated with the replication instance file ffff and journal pool shared memory id ssss; however, the process has already associated the database with a different replication instance file gggg or journal pool shmid tttt.

Action: A replicated database can only accept updates by processes that have the same replication instance file (defined by the environment variable gtm_repl_instance or in the global directory) open for that database. Ensure the same replication instance file is used for all processes that update the same replicated database file. This error can also occur if the replication instance file was recreated (while processes were still accessing the replication instance). In this case, the name ffff and gggg would be the same but the corresponding journal pool shared memory ids would be different. To recover from this situation, shut down all processes accessing the instance from before and after the instance file recreate. Run an argumentless MUPIP RUNDOWN to clean up the older journal pool tttt and restart the instance. The Source Server (which is the first process to start on a replicated instance) only binds replicated databases from its global directory to the journal pool that it creates. No other replicated database file can be bound with this journal pool.

--------------------
REPLINSTNMLEN 
--------------------

REPLINSTNMLEN, Replication instance name xxxx should be 1 to 15 characters long

MUPIP Error: This error is issued by the mupip replic instance_create command if the instance name was specified either through the name qualifier or through the environment variable gtm_repl_instname and if name was longer than 15 characters or was the empty string.

Action: Specify a valid instance name that is 1 to 15 characters long.

-------------------
REPLINSTNMSAME
-------------------

REPLINSTNMSAME, Primary and Secondary instances have the same replication instance name xxxx

MUPIP Error: This error is issued by any source server command where the -instsecondary qualifier specifies a secondary instance name that matches the name of the primary instance the command is started from.

Action: Two instances should never have the same name. Recreate the instance file on the secondary with a different name and restart the receiver server with the updateresync qualifier.

--------------------
REPLINSTNMUNDEF 
--------------------

REPLINSTNMUNDEF, Replication instance name not defined

MUPIP Error: This error is issued by the mupip replic -instance_create command if the -name qualifier was not specified and if the environment variable gtm_repl_instname is not defined either.

Action: Specify the instance name using the -name qualifier.

------------------
REPLINSTNOHIST 
------------------

REPLINSTNOHIST, REPLINSTNOHIST History record for xxxx not found in replication instance file yyyy

MUPIP Error: The source server or receiver server issue this message as an error while mupip rollback issues this message as a warning when they scan the replication instance file looking for a history record corresponding to a journal sequence number that is lesser than the earliest sequence number or greater than the latest sequence number stored in the instance file. This means that the replication instance files on the primary and secondary have differing level of history detail (possible if the instance file was later recreated in one instance) and that it is no longer possible to determine the sync point (resync seqno) between the two instances.

Action: If mupip rollback issues this error, it truncates the replication instance file history. This means that if this instance is a secondary, it should be brought up with the -updateresync qualifier. If the source or receiver server issue this error, this error needs to be handled by ensuring the primary and secondary databases are in sync (by shipping a copy of the database from the primary to the secondary if not already done), recreating the instance file on the secondary (if not already done) and start the receiver server on the secondary with the -updateresync qualifier.

-------------------
REPLINSTNOSHM
-------------------

REPLINSTNOSHM, Database dddd has no active connection to a replication journal pool

Run Time Error: The Source server was started with a repication instance that had this database file listed but later the source server and this particular database file were shut down while other database files in this instance file were still active.

Action: Restart the source server.

----------------------
REPLINSTOPEN 
----------------------

REPLINSTOPEN, Error opening replication instance file xxxx

Run Time Error: There was an error when YottaDB or MUPIP tried to open the replication instance file. The error detail accompanies this message.

Action: Look at the accompanying error detail. Possible causes are file permissions, system quotas, and so on. Fix the cause if possible. If not, report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel for further analysis.

--------------------
REPLINSTREAD 
--------------------

REPLINSTREAD, Error reading xxxx bytes at offset yyyy from replication instance file ffff

Run Time Error: There was an error when YottaDB or MUPIP tried to read from the replication instance file. The error detail accompanies this message.

Action: Look at the accompanying error detail. Possible causes are file permissions, system quotas, etc. Fix the cause if possible. If not, report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel for further analysis.

--------------------
REPLINSTSECLEN 
--------------------

REPLINSTSECLEN, REPLINSTSECLEN Secondary replication instance name xxxx should be 1 to 15 characters long

MUPIP Error: This error is issued by any mupip replic -source command that specifies a secondary instance name. This error is issued if the secondary instance name was specified either through the -instsecondary qualifier or through the environment variable gtm_repl_instsecondary and if the name was longer than 15 characters or was the empty string.

Action: Specify a valid secondary instance name that is 1 to 15 characters long.

----------------------
REPLINSTSECMTCH 
----------------------

REPLINSTSECMTCH, REPLINSTSECMTCH Secondary replication instance name xxxx sent by receiver does not match yyyy specified at source server startup

Source Server log/MUPIP Error: This error is issued by a source server that connects to a receiver server on the secondary and finds that the secondary instance name sent by the receiver does not match the secondary instance name specified (INSTSECONDARY qualifier) when the source server was started. The source server terminates after issuing this error.

Action: Restart the source server with the correct -instsecondary qualifier value. Also make sure the instance name in the -instsecondary qualifier and the host/port information in the secondary qualifier of the source server startup command correspond to each other.

--------------------
REPLINSTSECNONE
--------------------

REPLINSTSECNONE, No information found for secondary instance xxxx in instance file yyyy

MUPIP Error: This error is issued by any mupip replic source command that specifies a replicating (secondary) instance name (except for the one which specifies -start) if no information on this name can be found in the instance file. This is possible if no Source Server was ever started since the initialization of this instance file for such a replicating instance.

Action: Make sure the replicating instance name is correct. If it is, make sure a Source Server for that replicating instance has been started at least once in the life of the instance file even if it is currently not up and running.

------------------
REPLINSTSECUNDF 
------------------

REPLINSTSECUNDF, REPLINSTSECUNDF Secondary replication instance name not defined

MUPIP Error: This error is issued by any mupip replic -source command that requires a secondary instance name to be specified. The source server commands that require this qualifier are those that have any of -activate, changelog, deactivate, needrestart, start, statslog or stopsourcefilter specified. The secondary name can be specified either through the INSTSECONDARY qualifier or through the environment variable gtm_repl_instsecondary. If neither of them is specified, this error is issued.

Action: Specify the secondary instance name using the INSTSECONDARY qualifier.

------------------
REPLINSTSEQORD 
------------------

REPLINSTSEQORD, REPLINSTSEQORD ssss has seqno xxxx which is less than last record seqno yyyy in replication instance file zzzz

MUPIP Error: This error is issued in one of two scenarios. The instance file consists of a sequence of history records that should correspond to an increasing range of sequence numbers. They need to hence have their starting sequence number in increasing order. If an attempt is made to append a history record with a starting sequence number that is lesser than the last history record currently existing in the instance file, the source or receiver server issues this error. In this case ssss would be the string New history record. This error is also issued if at journal pool creation time, the source server notices that the instance file header has a value of the current seqno that is lesser than the starting seqno of the last history record in the instance file. In this case ssss would be the string Instance file header.

Action: If this instance is not the root primary, this error can be handled by restoring both the database and the instance file from a previous backup (consistent backup of the instance file AND database files taken together at the same time) and restarting the instance. Subsequent to such a restore, all transactions since the last backup will be sent across from this instance's primary. Alternatively, this can be handled by shipping a copy of the database from any other instance (either the primary or any other secondary/tertiary), recreating the instance file and starting this instance as a secondary with the UPDATERESYNC qualifier. In either case, this procedure has to be repeated on all tertiary instances etc. that descend from this instance ensuring that for every primary-secondary instance pair, the secondary is not ahead of the primary in terms of journal seqno. If this instance is the root primary, restoring from a prior backup may not be viable as it may mean loss of transactions that occurred after the backup. The alternative way to handle this error is to recreate the instance file on the root primary, ship a copy of the database from the primary and recreate instance files on ALL secondaries (tertiaries etc.) and restart the secondaries with the UPDATERESYNC qualifier. In addition, report the entire incident to your YottaDB support channel.

--------------------
REPLINSTSTNDALN 
--------------------

REPLINSTSTNDALN, REPLINSTSTNDALN Could not get exclusive access to replication instance file xxxx

MUPIP Error: This error is issued by MUPIP REPLIC INSTANCE_CREATE if it finds that the replication instance file it is attempting to create already exists and is being used (the journal pool for that instance exists) by YottaDB and/or MUPIP process(es).

Action: Shutdown all YottaDB and/or MUPIP processes that are using the replication instance file and reissue the command. If it fails even though you know for sure there is no other YottaDB or MUPIP process accessing the replication instance file, delete the instance file and reissue the command.

-------------------
REPLINSTUNDEF 
-------------------

REPLINSTUNDEF, Replication instance environment variable $gtm_repl_instance is undefined

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that the replication instance environment variable $gtm_repl_instance is undefined.

Action: Define the environment variable to the appropriate instance file.


--------------------
REPLINSTUNFROZEN 
--------------------

REPLINSTUNFROZEN, Instance xxxx is now Unfrozen

Run Time Information: This indicates that a replication instance which had previously been frozen is no longer frozen and updates to regions in the instance will resume.

Action: None required.

-------------------
REPLINSTWRITE
-------------------

REPLINSTWRITE, REPLINSTWRITE Error writing xxxx bytes at offset yyyy from replication instance file ffff

Run Time Error: There was an error when YottaDB or MUPIP tried to write to the replication instance file. The error detail accompanies this message.

Action: Look at the accompanying error detail. Possible causes are file permissions, system quotas, etc. Fix the cause if possible. If not, report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel.

---------------------
REPLJNLCLOSED
---------------------

REPLJNLCLOSED, Replication in jeopardy as journaling for database file ddd. Current region seqno is xxx[XXX] and system seqno is yyy[YYY]

Run Time Warning: This message indicates that YottaDB turned OFF journaling and switched replication from ON to WAS_ON on the specified database. Other preceding messages identify the cause (for example, lack of disk space while writing to journal file, permissions issue while auto-switching to new journal files,and so on). The message also displays the region and journal sequence numbers. From this point, replicating updates on the primary to the secondary might or might not work depending on the backlog on the primary until replication/journaling gets turned back ON.

Action: First, correct the cause (lack of disk space, permission issues, and so on) that turned journaling OFF.

Execute the MUPIP SET REPLICATION=ON or MUPIP BACKUP REPLICATION=ON command to turn replication (and journaling) ON and switch to a new set of journal files. This command can work while processes are concurrently updating the database and causes YottaDB to journal subsequent updates in both the journal file and journal pool (rather than only in the journal pool as it does when replication is in the WAS_ON state).

Execute the MUPIP REPLIC -SOURCE -SHOWBACKLOG command. Note down the value of "sequence number of last transaction written to journal pool".

Execute the above command at regular intervals and note down the value of "sequence number of last transaction sent by source server."

If the "sequence number of last transaction sent by source server" is greater than "sequence number of last transaction written to journal pool", it means that the source server successfully sent all journal records during the time interval when journaling was turned OFF. In this case, no further action is required.

On the other hand, if the "sequence number of last transaction sent by source server" is less than "sequence number of last transaction written to journal pool" and reports the same value across repeated SHOWBACKLOG commands, then check the source server log file for any error messages - most likely a NOPREVLINK error from the source server. This means the source server could not locate the corresponding journal records required from the journal files to replicate a particular sequence number and therefore, it failed to synchronize the primary and secondary. In this case, take an online backup of the primary, restore it on the secondary and start the secondary with the UPDATERESYNC qualifier to synchronize the secondary with the primary. 

---------------------
REPLJNLCNFLCT 
---------------------

REPLJNLCNFLCT, Journaling cannot be turned nnnn on database file ffff as the replication state is rrrr and must also be turned nnnn in the same command

MUPIP Warning: This message indicates that the requested journaling state (nnnn) and current replication state (rrrr) do not match and the command must explicitly specify an outcome such that they do match.

Action: Using DSE, dump the file header for each affected region. If the replication state is "WAS_ON" please consult the section on "Recovering from the replication WAS_ON state" from the `Administration and Operations Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/index.html>`_. For all other cases, issue one or more commands that leave journaling and replication either both ON or both OFF.

-----------------------
REPLLOGOPN 
-----------------------

REPLLOGOPN, Replication subsystem could not open log file LLLL : eeee. Logging done to OOOO

MUPIP Error: This indicates that MUPIP could not find, or did not have access permission to open, the log file LLLL, because of the error eeee. If there is another log file available (a previously opened file), MUPIP writes to the other log file OOOO. If there is no other log file available, MUPIP sends any remaining messages to /dev/null and terminates the replication server process.

Action: Check the log file permissions, and if permissions are correct, move the log file and specify that MUPIP should log to a log file which has appropriate access permissions. 

----------------------
REPLMULTINSTUPDATE
----------------------

REPLMULTINSTUPDATE, Previous updates in the current transaction are to xxxx so updates to yyyy (in rrrr) not allowed

Run Time Error: Previous updates in the current TP transaction mapped to database files associated with replication instance file xxxx, so it cannot make updates to database file yyyy which is associated with replication instance file rrrr.

Action: Modify the application so all updates in a TP transaction to replicated regions are associated with a single replication instance.

------------------
REPLNOBEFORE 
------------------

REPLNOBEFORE, NOBEFORE option cannot be used when the current replication state is ON for a database file xxxx

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that YottaDB could not use NOBEFORE journal option because replication is already turned ON for the database file xxxx.

Action: Use BEFORE option for the database file xxxx. NOBEFORE image journaling is not currently supported for replication. If NOBEFORE is necessary, use -replication=OFF option.

-----------------
REPLNOHASHTREC 
-----------------

REPLNOHASHTREC, Sequence number NNNN contains trigger definition updates. IIII side must be at least V6.2-000 for replication to continue

Receiver Server log/Source Server log Error: $ZTRIGGER() or MUPIP TRIGGER updated a trigger definition in a replicated region, but the replicating instance is running a version that cannot process trigger definitions from this version. Prior to V6.2-000 trigger maintenance actions replicated as data, while V6.2-000 and and later, trigger maintenance actions replicate as logical actions. V6.2-000 can reformat maintenace actions as data for older versions, but the current version cannot.

Action: Use V6.2-000 as a step on an upgrade path from earlier to later versions. Alternatively, if you need to perform trigger maintenance on replicating instances that are on either side of V6.2-000, you must perform them independently on the two systems when replication is off, recording and manipulating the sequence numbers such that you can resume replication.

---------------------
REPLNOMULTILINETRG 
---------------------

REPLNOMULTILINETRG, Sequence number ssss contains a trigger definition too large for transmission to the current replicating instance, which does not support multi-line triggers - stopping replication.

Trigger/Source Server log/MUPIP Error: The source server logs this message whenever it detects replication to a V5.4-001 or V5.4-000A instance of a transaction that involves multi-line triggers spanning across multiple blocks in the database, which is possible if the multi-line trigger definition is large enough that it does not fit in a single database block.

Action: Upgrade the replicating instance to at least V5.4-002 or eliminate any usages of large multi-line triggers spanning across database blocks from the application logic.

----------------------
REPLNOTLS 
----------------------

REPLNOTLS, xxxx requested TLS/SSL communication but the yyyy was either not started with TLSID qualifier or does not support TLS/SSL protocol

MUPIP Error: This indicates that xxxx (Source Side or Receiver Side) requested TLS/SSL communication but the other side was not started with a TLSID qualifier or was a previous version that does not support TLS/SSL protocol.

Action: If both sides are running with the latest version, then make sure the TLSID qualifier is specified for both the Source and Receiver Server startup commands. If one of the instances involved in the replication is a previous version, upgrade it to the latest version to support TLS.

-------------------
REPLNOTON
-------------------

REPLNOTON, Replication is not on for journal file xxxx, rollback will not continue

MUPIP Error: This indicates that ROLLBACK cannot proceed because MUPIP encountered xxxx, a journal file for which replication is not turned ON.

Action: ROLLBACK cannot be used for a journal file if it does not have replication state ON, use MUPIP JOURNAL RECOVER instead.

--------------------
REPLNOXENDIAN
--------------------

REPLNOXENDIAN, SSSS side is running on a YottaDB version that does not support cross-endian replication. Cannot continue.

MUPIP Error: The originating or the replicating instance in a cross-endian replication environment issue this error when a replication startup detects that the other side is running on a YottaDB version without needed cross-endian support.

Action: Upgrade the instance for which the error was reported to a version with support for cross-endian replication.

--------------------
REPLOFFJNLON
--------------------

REPLOFFJNLON, Replication state for database file <xxx> is OFF but journaling state is enabled.

MUPIP Error: In a replicated environment, this indicates that the database file <xxx> cannot have journaling ENABLED or ON when the replication state is OFF. This is an out of design situation due to implications on recovery as journal files can't be a mix of SET/KILL records that were created when replication was ON and those created when replication was OFF.

Action: In order to prevent this situation, enable replication state for the database file <xxx> (using MUPIP SET -REPLICATION=ON or MUPIP BACKUP -REPLICATION=ON) or disable journaling using MUPIP SET -JOURNAL=DISABLE whichever is desirable.

-------------------
REPLPOOLINST
-------------------

REPLPOOLINST, Error with replication pool xxxx for instance file yyyy

MUPIP Error: This indicates that MUPIP encountered an error for the replication shared memory of shared memory xxxx.

Action: Refer to the accompanied message(s) for detailed information.

----------------------
REPLRECFMT 
----------------------

REPLRECFMT, Replication journal record format error encountered

Source Server log/MUPIP Fatal: This indicates that a formatting error has been encountered by the replication source server for a journal record.

Action: Report the entire incident context along with any YottaDB logs, dump, and/or core files created within the same timeframe to your YottaDB support channel.

----------------------
REPLREQROLLBACK 
----------------------

REPLREQROLLBACK, Replication instance file xxxx indicates abnormal shutdown. Run MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK first.

MUPIP Error: This error is issued by MUPIP REPLIC SOURCE %C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9CSTART if it is about to create the journal pool and finds that the replication instance file header indicates the journal pool was not cleanly shutdown previously. This may cause the instance file not to correspond to the database and/or journals.

Action: Run MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK to cleanup the instance file, database and journal files before starting a source server on this instance.

----------------------
REPLREQRUNDOWN
----------------------

REPLREQRUNDOWN, Error accessing replication instance xxxx. Must be rundown on cluster node yyyy.

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that YottaDB could not open the specified replication instance file because it was not properly closed on the cluster node yyyy.

Action: Issue MUPIP RUNDOWN command on the cluster node. A YottaDB process or, replication server on that node may have been terminated by a method other than MUPIP STOP. If MUPIP RUNDOWN with no parameters fails, try MUPIP RUNDOWN region * with an appropriate global directory.

------------------------
REPLSRCEXITERR 
------------------------

REPLSRCEXITERR, Source server for secondary instance xxxx exited abnormally. See log file yyyy for details.

Operator log Warning: This indicates the the source server for instance xxxx exited abnormally.

Action: Check the end of the log file at yyyy for additional message(s).

--------------------------
REPLSTATE 
--------------------------

REPLSTATE, Replication state for region/database file xxxx is now yyyy

MUPIP Information: This indicates that replication state for region/database file xxxx, is now yyyy.

Action: -

-------------------------
REPLSTATEERR 
-------------------------

REPLSTATEERR, Replication state cannot be changed to the specified value for database file <xxx>.

MUPIP Error: This MUPIP BACKUP error indicates that the specified change in the replication state cannot be done due to the reason described in a following GTM-E-TEXT message.

Action: If the message indicates "Standalone access required", try to enable the replication in the standalone mode using MUPIP SET REPLICATION. If the message suggests switching journal file, specify the backup qualifier NEWJNL in the command line.


-----------------
REPLSTATEOFF
-----------------

REPLSTATEOFF, MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -BACKWARD cannot proceed as database xxxx does not have replication ON

MUPIP Error: This indicates that a MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -BACKWARD command cannot proceed because the specified database xxxx does not have replication state ON. In most situations, this error occurs when the journal file storage runs out of disk space.

Action: Ensure replication is turned ON for a database, before executing the MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -BACKWARD command. If the database is in the WAS_ON state, refer to the "Recovering from the WAS_ON state" section in the `Database Replication chapter of the Administration and Operations Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/dbrepl.html>`_. Alternatively, if replication was not in use on the database, use MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER.

---------------------
REPLTRANS2BIG 
---------------------

REPLTRANS2BIG, Transaction xxxx of size yyyy too large to be accommodated in the zzzz pool

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the size of the incoming transaction is larger than the specified receive pool.

Action: The receiver server must be shut down and restarted with a larger receive pool size or, if possible, break the file transmission into smaller files.

----------------------
REPLUPGRADEPRI
----------------------

REPLUPGRADEPRI, Attempted operation requires primary instance xxxx to support multi-site replication

MUPIP Error: This error is issued if an attempt is made to start an active source server or activate a passive source server on a propagating primary instance while the receiver server on that instance is connected to a primary that has not yet been upgraded to the multi-site version of YottaDB. This error is also issued when the receiver server on a propagating primary finds that the primary it connects to does not support multi-site replication and that there is at least one active source server running on the instance at that time.

Action: An active source server cannot be running on a secondary instance at the same time that the receiver server on this instance is connected to a primary that does not support multi-site functionality. Upgrade the primary instance identified in the message to the version of YottaDB that supports multi-site replication functionality and then start active source servers.

------------------------
REPLUPGRADESEC
------------------------

REPLUPGRADESEC, Attempted operation requires secondary instance xxxx to support multi-site replication

MUPIP Error: This error is issued in three cases. 1) If a source server is currently connected to a dual-site secondary (i.e. a secondary running on a version of YottaDB that does not support multi-site functionality), starting additional source servers will issue this error. 2) If a source server finds more than one source server (active or passive) running on the same instance at the time it connects to a dual-site secondary it will issue this error. 3) On a propagating primary instance, a source server that connects to a dual-site tertiary instance will issue a this error at connection time.

Action: Upgrade the secondary instance identified in the message to the version of YottaDB that supports multi-site replication functionality and then start multiple source servers.

----------------------------
REPLWARN 
----------------------------

REPLWARN, xxxx

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that YottaDB is performing tasks that may result in an error.

Action: Review accompanying messages for more information about why YottaDB generated this message. The Source Server exits with a REPLWARN message for the first five failed attempts to open journal files.

--------------------------
REPLXENDIANFAIL
--------------------------

REPLXENDIANFAIL, SSSS side encountered error while doing endian conversion at journal sequence number JJJJ

MUPIP Error: The originating or the replicating instance in a cross-endian replication environment report this error whenever they detect that the endian conversion failed.

Action: Restart replication - if the transmission caused the problem, it's probably intermittent. Perform a MUPIP JOURNAL -EXTRACT -DETAIL on the journal files and search for the sequence number JJJJ to look for anything different about that journal record. If the report is on the secondary, take a fresh backup on the originating instance requesting new journal files, refresh the replicating instance and restart replication.

----------------------
REQ2RESUME 
----------------------

REQ2RESUME, Request to resume suspended processing received from process xxxx owned by userid yyyy

Run Time Information: The information is logged to the operator facility. This indicates that a suspended process received signal SIGCONT to resume processing. This happens when a process is suspended while holding a scarce resource in order to permit other processes to access the resource. On systems that do not support advanced signal information, xxxx and yyyy both are 0 (zero).

Action: -

---------------------------
REQDVIEWPARM 
---------------------------

REQDVIEWPARM, Required View parameter is missing

Run Time Error: This indicates that the failed program attempted to use the VIEW function without specifying a keyword argument or with an invalid keyword argument.

Action: Programmer's should consult the `Programmer's Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/ProgrammersGuide/index.html>`_ for the correct syntax.

---------------------------
REQRECOV
---------------------------

REQRECOV, Error accessing database dddd. Must be recovered on cluster node ccccc.

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB could not open a previously journaled database file dddd due to a prior improper shutdown on cluster node ccccc. A YottaDB process on cluster node ccccc may have failed to attach a database memory segment or it was terminated by a method other than MUPIP STOP.

Action: Perform a MUPIP JOURNAL RECOVER operation to address this issue.

-------------------------
REQRLNKCTLRNDWN
-------------------------

REQRLNKCTLRNDWN, Error accessing relinkctl file rrrr for $ZROUTINES directory dddd. Must be rundown

Run Time Error: A process initiated an auto-relink action with ZLINK or ZRUPDATE, or an auto-relink check with DO, GOTO, ZBREAK, ZGOTO, ZPRINT or $TEXT() which required adding information for the routine in question to the Relinkctl file rrrr for directory dddd, but the shared memory associated with that Relinkctl file had been removed, presumably by an operator using a ipcrm.

Action: Run MUPIP RUNDOWN -RELINKCTL dddd to clear the state of the Relinkctl file. Determine the cause for the improper close and take action to prevent additional occurrences.

----------------------------
REQROLLBACK 
----------------------------

REQROLLBACK, Error accessing database dddd. Run MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -NOONLINE on cluster node cccc.

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB could not open a previously replicated database file dddd due to a prior improper shutdown on cluster node cccc. A YottaDB process on cluster node ccccc may have failed to attach a database memory segment or it was terminated by a method other than MUPIP STOP.

Action: Perform MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -NOONLINE to cleanup the instance file, database, and journal files before starting a source server on this instance.

--------------------
REQRUNDOWN
--------------------

REQRUNDOWN, Error accessing database dddd. Must be rundown on cluster node ccccc.

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB could not open database file dddd due to a prior improper shutdown on cluster node ccccc. A YottaDB process on cluster node ccccc may have failed to attach a database memory segment or it was terminated by a method other than MUPIP STOP.

Action: Perform MUPIP RUNDOWN from cluster node ccccc. If MUPIP RUNDOWN with no parameters does not work, specify the region name or file-specification with -REGION or -FILE, respectively.

----------------------
RESOLVESEQNO 
----------------------

RESOLVESEQNO, Resolving until sequence number dddd [0xxxxx]

MUPIP Information: This indicates MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK expects to do backward processing until it reaches sequence number with hexadecimal value xxxx (decimal value dddd). This is usually the common sequence number agreed upon between the primary and secondary by a -FETCHRESYNC rollback or the sequence number specified in a -RESYNC rollback.

Action: No action required.

-----------------------
RESOLVESEQSTRM 
-----------------------

RESOLVESEQSTRM, Resolving until stream sequence number Stream nnnn : Seqno dddd xxxx

MUPIP Information: This indicates MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK expects to do backward processing until it reaches the stream sequence number whose hexadecimal value is xxxx (decimal value dddd). This is usually the common stream sequence number agreed upon between the primary and secondary by a -FETCHRESYNC rollback or the stream sequence number specified in a -RESYNC rollback where -RSYNC_STRM is also specified.

Action: No action required.

---------------------------
RESRCINTRLCKBYPAS
---------------------------

RESRCINTRLCKBYPAS, tttt with PID qqqq bypassing the ssss semaphore for region rrrr (ffff) currently held by PID pppp.

All YottaDB Components Information: YottaDB issues the RESRCINTRLCKBYPAS message to the system log as an indication it may not detect when the last process detaches from the shared resource and therefore may not rundown the database shared resources as it normally would. YottaDB protects the actions of setting up and tearing down the shared resources associated with a database with a pair of semaphores. Because DSE, and LKE are tools for diagnosing issues, when they start and find they cannot acquire the semaphores after a reasonable number of tries, they proceed to open the database anyway because it is highly probable the database is already set up. When DSE and LKE bypass the semaphore acquisition, they leave the count of attached processes incorrect. When many processes terminate at the same time, typically because of a system shutdown, there can be significant contention for the semaphores that can cause their terminations to take an unusually long time. When this happens, and the count of remaining attached processes is significant, a process may skip the semaphore acquisition, again leaving the count of attached process incorrect. If either of these events occurs, YottaDB issues the RESRCINTRLCKBYPAS message where tttt identifies the process type: "LKE", "DSE" or "YottaDB"; qqqq is the bypassing process's PID; ssss identifies the semaphore type: "FTOK" or "access control"; rrrr is the region bypassed; ffff is the file corresponding to region rrrr; pppp is the PID of the process holding the semaphore.

Action: These messages when shutting down YottaDB activity may indicate a need to complete the process by invoking a MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -BACKWARD for replicated databases, a MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER -BACKWARD for unreplicated journaled databases and a MUPIP RUNDOWN for journal-free databases to get the database to a safe state; doing so as part of every shutdown is good practice.

---------------------
RESRCWAIT
---------------------

RESRCWAIT, Waiting briefly for the tttt semaphore for region rrrr (ffff) was held by PID pppp (Sem. ID: ssss)

Run Time Information: A process started a three (3) second wait for an FTOK or access control semaphore. If process with PID pppp does not release the semaphore before the timeout expires, the waiting process bypasses acquiring the semaphore. tttt identifies the semaphore type: "FTOK" or "access control"; rrrr is the region; ffff is the database file corresponding to region rrrr; ssss is the semaphore ID.

Action: None required.

---------------------
RESTRICTEDOP
---------------------

RESTRICTEDOP, Attempt to perform a restricted operation: xxxx

All YottaDB Components Error: The attempted operation, xxxx, was prevented based on the policy specified by the $gtm_dist/restrict.txt file.

Action: Check the permissions and contents of the restrict.txt file against the permissions of the user performing the operation.

-------------------
RESTRICTSYNTAX
-------------------

RESTRICTSYNTAX, Syntax error in file ffff at line number nnnn. All facilities restricted for process.

All YottaDB Components Error: The file ffff, or $gtm_dist/restrict.txt, contains a syntax error at line nnnn. All facilities which may be specified in a restrict.txt file will be considered restricted, and restricted operations will result in RESTRICTEDOP errors or operations being ignored.

Action: Edit the restrict.txt file to remove the syntax error, and verify the permissions of the file reflect the desired access.

------------------
RESUMESTRMNUM 
------------------

RESUMESTRMNUM, Error with stream number specified in RESUME qualifier

MUPIP Error: Issued by a Receiver Server as an accompanying message to a UPDSYNCINSTFILE error. The stream number nnnn can be any integer value from -1 through 15.

Action: No action required for this message. Action is required for the preceding UPDSYNCINSTFILE error.

--------------------------
RESYNCSEQLOW 
--------------------------

RESYNCSEQLOW, MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -FORWARD -RESYNC=NNNN [0xXXXX] requested is lower than LLLL which is the starting sequence number for the instance

MUPIP Error: The MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -FORWARD command has a -RESYNC qualifier value (NNNN in decimal or XXXX in hexidecimal) lower than that (LLLL) of the instance to the target instance.

Action: Reissue the command after adjusting the resync value and/or adopting a different target instance.

-----------------------
REUSEINSTNAME 
-----------------------

REUSEINSTNAME, Error with instance name specified in REUSE qualifier

MUPIP Error: Issued by a Receiver Server when started with the -REUSE qualifier in case of either inappropriate use of this qualifier or an inappropriate instance name specified as a value to this qualifier.

Action: An accompanying GTM-I-TEXT message describes the particular error situation. Take appropriate corrective action based on that.

In such a case, MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK can only create broken and lost transaction files (if appropriate) but otherwise not modify the database, journal files, or replication instance files.

Action: No user action required except to confirm that this type of rollback is appropriate and expected.

-----------------
RLBKNOBIMG
-----------------

RLBKNOBIMG, ROLLBACK cannot proceed as database dddd has NOBEFORE_IMAGE journaling

MUPIP Error: Rollback relies on BEFORE_IMAGE journaling and dddd did not have it turned on, so no rollback is currently possible.

Action: Restore the database from a backup and use forward recovery or a replication resynchronization to recover the database state. Use BEFORE_IMAGE journaling for databases you wish to be able to rollback.

-------------------
RLBKSTRMSEQ 
-------------------

RLBKSTRMSEQ, Stream journal seqno of the instance after rollback is Stream nnnn : Seqno dddd xxxx

------------------------
SHMPLRECOV 
------------------------

SHMPLRECOV, Shared memory pool block recovery invoked for region xxxx

Run Time Information: YottaDB carves out a portion of shared memory/global section allocated for each database region to use for ONLINE BACKUP - this portion is called "shared memory pool". In the unlikely event of corruption of the shared memory pool, or if the blocks are "lost" due to stopped/killed or failed processes, YottaDB detects the corruption or lost blocks and runs a recovery procedure to fix these errors. Such an occurrence is logged in the operator log (syslog on UNIX) with SHMLRECOV message.

Action: Report the occurrence to your YottaDB support channel. No user action required. YottaDB will continue to operate normally.

-------------------

Action: Upgrade the database to V5 and re-run the action.

------------------
STACKCRIT 
------------------

STACKCRIT, Stack space critical

Run Time Error: This indicates that the process has consumed almost all of the available stack space.

Action: Look for infinite recursion. If you do not take immediate action to reduce your stack, YottaDB is likely to produce a STACKOFLOW error, which terminates the process. Examine the stack with ZSHOW. Trim the stack using QUIT, ZGOTO, HALT or ZHALT.

-----------------
STACKOFLOW 
-----------------

STACKOFLOW, Stack overflow

Run Time Fatal: This indicates that the process required more stack space than was available in memory.

Action: Address the condition causing the error and retry.

------------------
STATSDBINUSE 
------------------

STATSDBINUSE, Statistics database SSSS is in use with database DDDD so cannot also be used with database OOOO

Run Time Error: The statistics database SSSS is currently associated with database DDDD and therefore cannot be associated with database OOOO.

Action: Determine why two separate base databases would be trying to both use the same statistics database (often this is because statistics database names are soft linked to each other), fix the condition, and retry.

-----------------
STATSDBNOTSUPP 
-----------------

STATSDBNOTSUPP, Attempted operation is not supported on statistics database file SSSS

All YottaDB Components Error: An attempt was made to use a statistics database in a manner that is not supported. Statistics databases have very restricted capabilities, for example: they only accept updates from YottaDB itself.

Action: Identify and remove the inappropriate action(s).

-----------------
STDNULLCOLLREQ 
-----------------

STDNULLCOLLREQ, Region rrrr needs Standard Null Collation enabled because global gggg spans through it

GDE Information: This indicates that the global gggg spans through region rrrr but the region has YottaDB Null collation enabled.

Action: All regions containing parts of spanning globals need to have Standard Null Collation enabled. Fix region rrrr to have Standard Null Collation enabled.

--------------------
STOPTIMEOUT 
--------------------

STOPTIMEOUT, Waited too long for stopped process to release. Region: xxxx.

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB is ignoring and bypassing a locked process and a recovery mechanism has taken control of the listed region.

Action: Terminate the misbehaving process.

----------------
STPCRIT
----------------

STPCRIT, String pool space critical

Run Time Error: This indicates that the process has exceeded the heap (string pool) limit specified in the $ZSTRPLLIM ISV. If you do not take prompt action to reduce the process memory requirements, at the next heap expansion, YottaDB produces an STPOFLOW error, which terminates the process.

Action: Investigate whether the process memory usage is appropriate, and if so, increase or remove the limit. Otherwise correct the cause(s) of the excessive memory consumption. Please see the documentation for $ZSTRPLLIM for additional information.

----------------
STPEXPFAIL 
----------------

STPEXPFAIL, Stringpool expansion failed. It could not expand to xxxx bytes

Run Time Error: The stringpool, an internally expanding data structure maintained by YottaDB to store primarily M-local variable content, needs more memory than is available in the process virtual memory.

Action: Increase process memory quotas to increase available process virtual memory. Change application to reduce memory requirements of the stringpool by using lesser M-local variables.

----------------
STPOFLOW
----------------

STPOFLOW, String pool space overflow

Run Time Fatal: This indicates that the process has previously exceeded the heap (string pool) limit specified in the $ZSTRPLLIM ISV and still needs more memory, so YottaDB terminates the process.

Action: Investigate whether the process memory usage is appropriate, and if so, increase or remove the limit. Otherwise correct the cause(s) of the excessive memory consumption. Please see the documentation for $ZSTRPLLIM for additional information.

------------------
STRINGOFLOW 
------------------

STRINGOFLOW, String pool overflow

Compile Time Error: This indicates that some action attempted to use the string pool when it was full.

Action: Look for very large string constants in a very large program; reduce one or both.

-----------------
STRMISSQUOTE 
-----------------

STRMISSQUOTE, Missing double-quote at end of string specification ssss

GDE Error: This indicates that a subscripted name was specified with string subscripts parts of which were enclosed inside double-quotes but the closing double-quote is missing.

Action: Specify the subscripted name with the appropriate double quote(s).

------------------

----------------

STRMNUMMISMTCH1, Stream nnnn exists on the receiver instance file but is unknown on the source instance

MUPIP Error: Issued by a Source Server on a Supplementary Instance when it detects a non-Supplementary stream number nnnn (which can be any value from 1 through 15) exists on the receiving instance but not on the source instance. This indicates the two instances are not in sync at least with respect to stream nnnn, so replication cannot proceed.

Action: Reinitialize the receiving instance from a backup of the source instance and restart replication between the two instances.

---------------------
STRMNUMMISMTCH2 
---------------------

STRMNUMMISMTCH2, Stream nnnn exists on the source instance file but is unknown on the receiver instance

MUPIP Error: Issued by a Source Server on a supplementary instance when it detects a non-Supplementary stream number nnnn (which can be any value from 1 through 15) exists on the source instance but not on the receiving instance. This indicates the two instances are not in sync at least with respect to stream nnnn and so replication cannot proceed.

Action: Reinitialize the receiving instance from a backup of the source instance and restart replication between the two instances.

----------------------
STRMSEQMISMTCH 
----------------------

STRMSEQMISMTCH, Unable to play update on Stream nnnn with seqno xxxx as receiving instance has a different stream seqno XXXX

Update Process log/MUPIP Error: Issued by the Update Process on a supplementary instance started with -UPDNOTOK (that is, local updates are disabled) when it finds the source and receiving instances have different values of stream sequence number for the non-Supplementary stream nnnn (can be any value from 1 through 15). This indicates the two instances are not in sync at least with respect to stream nnnn and so replication cannot proceed.

Action: Reinitialize the receiving instance from a backup of the source instance and restart replication between the two instances.

-------------------
STRNOTVALID 
-------------------

STRNOTVALID, Error: cannot convert xxxx value to valid yyyy value.

DSE Error: This error shows in DSE when there is a string input that cannot be converted to a number. For example, attempting "change -fileheader -location=0x123rt456" would apply to this error.

Action: Review and correct typographical errors.

----------------
STRUNXEOR
----------------

STRUNXEOR, xxxx unexpected end of record in string subscript

MUPIP Error: This indicates that LOAD aborted because it encountered an end of file while processing string subscript xxxx.

Action: Refer to the topic `MUPIP LOAD Errors in the About This Manual section <https://docs.yottadb.com/MessageRecovery/about.html#mupip-load-errors>`_.

-----------------

-------------------

SUPRCVRNEEDSSUPSRC, Instance iiii is not configured to perform local updates, so it cannot act as a receiver for non-Supplementary Instance ssss

MUPIP Error: Issued by a Receiver Server or a MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -FETCHRESYNC on a Supplementary Instance ssss started with -UPDNOTOK attempted to connect to non-Supplementary Instance iiii. A Supplementary Instance that does not permit local updates can only replicate from another Supplementary Instance.

Action: Reconfigure the instances to a supported configuration.

------------------
SUSPENDING 
------------------

SUSPENDING, Suspending processing on user request or attempt to do terminal I/O while running in the background

Run Time Information: The message signifies that a YottaDB process is suspended on user initiated ^Z (or key stroke that is set to shell "susp"). It is also displayed if the process attempts to do terminal I/O while running in the background. Before suspending itself, the process logs the SUSPENDING message to the operator facility. Suspended processes may be automatically released from that state if they hold a shared resource that blocks other processes.

Action: Because YottaDB uses shared resources, suspending a YottaDB process can lock those resources and prevent other processes from working. Disable process suspension from <CTRL-Z> by appropriately configuring the shell. If you find a GTM-I-SUSPENDING in the syslog, match it with a GTM-I-REQ2RESUME to ensure that the process went back to work and released any resources it had. Identify the cause of the suspension and take action to prevent a recurrence. If there is no resume, check the process listing to confirm that there is a shell associated with the process and request the user to unsuspend the process. If there is no shell associated with process, it is likely that the process was backgrounded before the shell was terminated. Kill this process with MUPIP STOP.

-------------------
SVNEXPECTED
-------------------

SVNEXPECTED, Special variable expected in this context

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB encountered a dollar sign in a NEW command that was not followed by a valid special variable name.

Action: Look for misspelled special variable names or a missing $ in an extrinsic.

--------------------
SVNONEW 
--------------------

SVNONEW, Cannot NEW this special variable

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that a NEW command tried to new an intrinsic special variable that is not a valid argument for a NEW.

Action: Look for inappropriate $ prefixes. $ZTRAP, $ETRAP, $ESTACK, $ZYERROR, $ZGBLDIR are the only intrinsic special variables that can be NEWed.

------------------
SVNOSET 
------------------

SVNOSET, Cannot SET this special variable

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a SET command specified an assignment that attempted to modify a read-only special variable.

Action: Look for inappropriate $ prefixes and attempts to modify read-only special variables. $DEVICE, $ECODE, $ETRAP, $DEVICE, $KEY, $X, and $Y are the only ANSI standard variables that can be SET.

------------------
SYSCALL
------------------

SYSCALL, Error received from system call xxxx -- called from module yyyy at line zzzz

Run Time Error: This indicates that system call failed due to some unusual error condition.

Action: Report to system administrator and if necessary report the entire incident context to your YottaDB support channel for further analysis.

--------------
TCGETATTR
--------------

TCGETATTR, Error while getting terminal attributes on file descriptor xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that the terminal attributes are inaccessible where xxxx is the file descriptor for the device.

Action: Review and correct the OS configuration of the device.

-------------------
TCOMMITDISALLOW 
-------------------

TCOMMITDISALLOW, TROLLBACK required after an unhandled error in trigger context

Run Time Error: This transaction did an update that invoked a trigger which in turn encountered an error that was not handled by the application error trap inside the trigger context. Because of this, the exit from trigger context was abnormal. YottaDB does not commit such transactions since they would not preserve the atomicity of trigger updates (triggering update + triggered updates).

Action: Such transactions can only be rolled back. If this is a nested TSTART (subtransaction), it can optionally be rolled back incrementally, that is, only the nested TSTART needs to be rolled back while the parent TSTART can still be committed.

-------------------
TCSETATTR 
-------------------

TCSETATTR, Error while setting terminal attributes on file descriptor xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that the terminal attributes are inaccessible where xxxx is the file descriptor for the device.

Action: Review and correct the OS configuration of the device.

------------------
TERMASTQUOTA 
------------------

TERMASTQUOTA, Process AST quota exceeded, cannot open terminal

Run Time Error: This indicates that an OPEN command failed because it required an AST that would violate the process quota.

Action: Reduce the number of terminals in use by a single process or ask your system administrator about changing your AST quota.

-------------------
TERMWRITE 
-------------------

TERMWRITE, Error writing to terminal, status:

Run Time Error: This indicates that a WRITE to a terminal failed. Such failures may be detected and reported asynchronously to the actual WRITE command.

Action: Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information.

-------------------
TEXT 
-------------------

TEXT, xxxx

Run Time Information: YottaDB uses this message with various accompanying text, xxxx, to expand on other errors.

Action: Examine the text and review any accompanying message(s).

------------------
TEXTARG 
------------------

TEXTARG, Invalid argument to $TEXT function

Compile Time Error: This indicates that a $TEXT function specified an invalid argument.

Action: Modify the $TEXT() argument so it is in the format of an entryref.

---------------------
TIMERHANDLER 
---------------------

TIMERHANDLER, Incorrect SIGALRM handler xxxx found by yyyy

Run Time Information: This indicates that an external user-supplied routine (C or other language) called from YottaDB, incorrectly manipulated the system timer handler. The xxxx is the hexadecimal address of the handler installed by the external routine and yyyy is the routine within YottaDB, which discovered the problem.

Action: Use the YottaDB-provided timer facility described in the `Programmer's Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/ProgrammersGuide/index.html>`_ .

-----------------
TIMEROVFL 
-----------------

TIMEROVFL, Timer overflow; interval probably too large

Run Time Error: This indicates that a timeout or timers calculation exceeded the maximum allowable interval.

Action: Check the system maximum interval and set the interval accordingly.

------------------
TIMRBADVAL
------------------

TIMRBADVAL, Bad value specified. Timer not changed.

DSE Error: This indicates that a CHANGE command with the FILEHEADER qualifier specified a time value that was improperly formatted or inappropriate.

Action: Modify the time value.

------------------
TLSCONNINFO 
------------------

TLSCONNINFO, Failed to obtain information on the TLS/SSL connection

MUPIP Warning: This indicates that an attempt to establish TLS/SSL connection failed.

Action: Review the following TEXT message from the plug-in for additional diagnostic information and adjust the environment accordingly.

-------------------
TLSCONVSOCK 
-------------------

TLSCONVSOCK, Failed to convert UNIX TCP/IP socket to TLS/SSL aware socket>/error

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that an attempt to establish TLS/SSL connection failed.

Action: Review the following TEXT message from the plug-in for additional diagnostic information, review your keys and related certificates, and adjust the environment accordingly.

--------------------
TLSDLLNOOPEN 
--------------------

TLSDLLNOOPEN, Failed to load YottaDB TLS/SSL library for secure communication

MUPIP Error: This indicates that the attempt to load the YottaDB dynamically linked library for TLS/SSL operation failed.

Action: Review the following TEXT message from the plug-in for additional diagnostic information, check the path and authorizations for the library, and adjust the environment accordingly.

-----------------
TLSHANDSHAKE 
-----------------

TLSHANDSHAKE, Connection to remote side using TLS/SSL protocol failed

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that an attempt to establish SSL/TLS connection failed.

Action: Review the following TEXT message from the plug-in for additional diagnostic information, and adjust the environment accordingly.

------------------
TLSINIT 
------------------

TLSINIT, Failed to initialize YottaDB TLS/SSL library for secure communication

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that the attempt to initialize a secure context for TLS/SSL operation failed.

Action: Review the following TEXT message from the plug-in for additional diagnostic information, check your certificates, and adjust the environment accordingly.

------------------
TLSIOERROR 
------------------

TLSIOERROR, Error during TLS/SSL oooo operation

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that while attempting oooo operation (receive or send), the TLS/SSL library encountered an error.

Action: Review the following TEXT message from the plug-in for additional diagnostic information, and adjust the environment accordingly.

--------------------
TLSPARAM 
--------------------

TLSPARAM, TLS parameter pppp eeee

Run Time Error: This indicates a problem with a parameter on a WRITE /TLS command. pppp identifies the parameter and eeee describes the problem.

Action: Address the reported problem described by eeee.

---------------------
TLSRENEGOTIATE 
---------------------

TLSRENEGOTIATE, Failed to renegotiate TLS/SSL connection

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This indicates that an attempt to renegotiate the SSL/TLS connection failed.

Action: Review the following TEXT message from the plug-in for additional diagnostic information, and adjust the environment accordingly.

---------------------
TLVLZERO 
---------------------

TLVLZERO, Transaction is not in progress

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that a TCOMMIT, TROLLBACK, or TRESTART command attempted to change the state of the current transaction; however, a transaction was not in progress.

Action: Look for missing TSTARTs, extra TCOMMITs or TROLLBACKs, or an unanticipated flow of control; conditionalize the command on $TLEVEL, if appropriate.

----------------
TMPFILENOCRE
----------------

TMPFILENOCRE, Error in MUPIP BACKUP while trying to create temporary file xxxx

MUPIP Error: This indicates that MUPIP BACKUP was not able to create the temporary file xxxx needed in the course of its processing, possibly due to earlier incomplete backups.

Action: Make sure the temporary files are removed from the backup directory, and re-issue the BACKUP.

-------------------
TMPSTOREMAX 
-------------------

TMPSTOREMAX, Maximum space for temporary values exceeded

Compile Time Error: YottaDB uses 1024 temporary registers to hold intermediate results of expression evaluation. Because of the line-oriented nature of the M language, these temporary registers get reused for each line. This error indicates that there is a single calculation on a line that requires more than 1024 temporary registers.

Action: Look for excessive function nesting on a very long line of code. Reduce the amount of nesting by assigning intermediate results to a variable. Alternatively, if compiling the routine with the -DYNAMIC_LITERALS qualifier, try compiling with -NODYNAMIC_LITERALS.

-----------------
TNTOOLARGE
-----------------

TNTOOLARGE, Database file xxx has reached the transaction number limit (0xaaa). Renew database with MUPIP INTEG TN_RESET

Run Time Information: This indicates that YottaDB detected that the transaction numbers in the named database have reached the maximum number. Note that the actual maximum TN is less than this theoretical limit. DSE DUMP FILEHEADER shows what the limit is. The actual limit reflects some overhead used, for example, during a TN_RESET operation.

Action: Use MUPIP INTEG with the qualifier TN_RESET to reset the transaction numbers in the database. If the database is in a previous format, consider converting it to the most recent format. The database cannot otherwise be used until the condition is removed by either a TN_RESET or, if a previous version of the database, changing the output mode to the latest version with MUPIP SET VERSION.

----------------------
TNWARN 
----------------------

TNWARN, Database file xxx has 0xaaa more transactions to go before reaching the transaction number limit (0xaaa). Renew database with MUPIP INTEG TN_RESET.

Run Time Information: This indicates that YottaDB detected that the transaction numbers in the named database are approaching the maximum number. This message is sent to the operator log periodically at decreasing intervals as the transaction number approaches the maximum. Note that the actual maximum TN is less than this theoretical limit. DSE DUMP FILEHEADER shows what the limit is. The actual limit reflects some overhead used,for example, during a TN_RESET operation.

Action: Use MUPIP INTEG with the qualifier TN_RESET to reset the transaction numbers in the database. If the database is in a previous format, consider converting it to the most recent format.

------------------
TOOMANYCLIENTS
------------------

TOOMANYCLIENTS, YottaDB is serving the maximum number of clients. Try again later.

Run Time Error: This indicates that the process failed in accessing a region served via GT.CM server, which currently cannot accept another connection. This is unlikely to happen unless many of the servers clients have abruptly disconnected and the server has been running for a long time.

Action: Try again later. Stop and restart the server to resolve the problem. If the problem persists, contact the group responsible for database operations on your network.

--------------------
TOTALBLKMAX 
--------------------

TOTALBLKMAX, Extension exceeds maximum total blocks, not extending

Run Time Error: This indicates that the database file extension specified implicitly or explicitly (using MUPIP EXTEND) would cause the GDS file to exceed the maximum size of 64 million blocks.

Action: Modify the extension to use a smaller size. This may indicate that you should move some contents of the database file to another file.

--------------------
TPFAIL
--------------------

TPFAIL, Transaction COMMIT failed. failure code: xxxx.

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB attempted to process this transaction four times, but encountered an error every time. xxxx contains the failure codes for the four attempts. It is very likely that the database may have integrity errors or that the process-private data structures are corrupted.

Action: Report this database error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation.

-----------------
TPLOCK 
-----------------

TPLOCK, Cannot release lock(s) held prior to current TSTART

Run Time Error: This indicates that a LOCK or ZDEALLOCATE command attempted to release named resources that were LOCKed or ZALLOCATEd prior to the initial TSTART of the current transaction.

Action: Do not release the named resource until after the TCOMMIT, or LOCK/ZALLOCATE has reserved the resource after the TSTART has begun.


------------------
TPLOCKRESTMAX 
------------------

TPLOCKRESTMAX, Transaction restarts due to unavailability of locks not allowed in a final TP retry more than nnnn times

Run Time Error: This indicated a timed LOCK within a transaction was consistently unavailable. In order to prevent the process from waiting for the LOCK while holding a database resource (critical section) the transaction has restarted nnnn times without success. This error limits the possibilities for this issue cascading into a live-lock (consuming resources trying to do something that is "not happening").

Action: Analyze the locking protocol for issues of deadlock or unexpected LOCK durations and rework appropriately. Note that YottaDB recommends against using LOCKs within transactions, as YottaDB protects the transaction integrity independent of LOCK protocols. If you wish to impose a conventional locking strategy for a transaction, place the LOCK and unlock around (outside) the transaction. While it is possible to use a LOCK within a transaction for signaling, that technique is typically problematic as it violates transactional Isolation and should likely be restricted to testing.

-------------------
TPMIXUP
-------------------

TPMIXUP, xxxx transaction cannot be started within yyyy transaction

Run Time Error: This indicates that the software, function, or routine may use incompatible transaction fencing.

Action: Transaction fences and ZT transaction fences cannot be used in combination. Review the code for incompatible use of T and ZT transaction fences.

----------------
TPNOSTATSHARE
----------------

TPNOSTATSHARE, VIEW "[NO]STATSHARE" is not allowed inside a TP transaction

Run Time Error: Because statistics sharing is a non-ACID (due to not being Isolated) action YottaDB does that permit changing it within a TP transaction.

Action: Move any switching of statistics outside of any TP transaction.

----------------
TPNOSUPPORT
----------------

TPNOSUPPORT, Operation cannot be performed while inside of a TP transaction

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $$set^%GBLDEF or $$kill^%GBLDEF was attempted while inside of a TP transaction (TSTART/TCOMMIT fence).

Action: ^%GBLDEF only supports TP from the $$get entry point; it does not support inclusion of $$set or $$kill entry points within a TP transaction.

---------------
TPNOTACID 
---------------

TPNOTACID, tttt at xxxx in a final TP retry violates ACID properties of a TRANSACTION; indefinite RESTARTs may occur

Run Time Information: YottaDB issues this message if it is executing a TP TRANSACTION in the final retry and control gets transferred out of YottaDB due to any one of the following three conditions: 

1. ZSYSTEM command
2. Entering direct mode (e.g. due to a BREAK command) or 
3. a long running command (those which accept timeout specifications) encountered potentially indefinite restarts. The xxxx indicates the $ZPOSITION where the transfer of control occurred and the condition that caused this is identified in tttt. 

Action: Review your code to determine whether the non-Isolated commands can be moved outside of transaction encapsulation. Alternatively, ensure that they are minimally disruptive by using $ZMAXTPTIME to prevent transactions from running unreasonably long times and setting gtm_tpnotacidtime to specify the wait period for long running commands before YottaDB logs a TPNOTACID message.

.. note::
   Because a process that gives a TPNOTACID message is in an indefinite restart, it might fail to produce an error indicating database damage should it encounter such an unlikely eventuality. In this case, indefinite restarts do not cause any additional damage. 

---------------
TPQUIT 
---------------

TPQUIT, Cannot QUIT out of a routine with an active transaction

Run Time Error: This indicates that an implicit or explicit QUIT attempted to leave an invocation level where a transaction or subtransaction was TSTARTed but not matched by either a TCOMMIT or TROLLBACK.

Action: Modify the routine to TCOMMIT or TROLLBACK the transaction before QUITting, or move the TSTART to a prior invocation level.

--------------
TPRESTART 
--------------

TPRESTART, Database mmmm; code: xxxx; blk: yyyy in glbl: zzzz; pvtmods: aaaa, blkmods: bbbb, blklvl: cccc, type: dddd, readset: eeee, writeset: ffff, local_tn: gggg, zpos: hhhh

Run Time Information: The UNIX environment variables GTM_TPRESTART_LOG_FIRST and GTM_TPRESTART_LOG_DELTA control the logging of TPRESTART messages. GTM_TPRESTART_LOG_FIRST indicates the number of TP restarts to log from a YottaDB invocation. Once that many have been logged, every GTM_TPRESTART_LOG_DELTA TP restarts, YottaDB logs a restart message. If GTM_TPRESTART_LOG_DELTA is undefined, YottaDB performs no operator logging. The default value for GTM_TPRESTART_LOG_FIRST is 0 (zero), which leaves the control completely with GTM_TPRESTART_LOG_DELTA. The facility that produces this message can serve as a diagnostic tool in developmental environments for investigating contention due to global updates. A zzzz of "\*BITMAP" indicates contention in block allocation which might involve multiple globals. hhhh is the $ZPOSITION of the line of M code that caused the restart of the transaction; utilities leave this field blank.

Action: Disable, or adjust the frequency of, these messages with the mechanism described above. To reduce the number of restarts, consider changes to the global structure, or varying the time when work is scheduled. Consider whether the business and program logic permits the use of NOISOLATION.

---------------------
TPRESTNESTERR
---------------------

TPRESTNESTERR, TP restart signaled while handing error - treated as nested error - Use TROLLBACK in error handler to avoid this

Run Time Error: YottaDB does not allow a TP restart to occur either explicitly or implicitly while doing error processing ($ECODE is not NULL). Note that if a $ZINTERRUPT interrupts an error handler, this restriction then extends to the $ZInterrupt code even though $ECODE is temporarily nullified for the duration of the $ZInterrupt.

Action: Doing a TROLLBACK in the error handler before attempting to set any globals avoids this error.

------------------
TPSTACKCRIT 
------------------

TPSTACKCRIT, TP Stack space critical

Run Time Error: This indicates that a transaction has consumed almost all of the available stack space.

Action: Look for missing TCOMMIT commands. Modify the code to reduce the total change content of the transaction; pay special attention to recursion and variable usage.


---------------
TPSTACKOFLOW 
---------------

TPSTACKOFLOW, TP Stack overflow

Run Time Error: This indicates that a transaction has consumed all of the available stack space. This error terminates the image.

Action: Modify the error handling for TPSTACKCRIT to prevent a subsequent TPSTACKOFLOW.

------------------
TPTIMEOUT
------------------

TPTIMEOUT, Transaction timeout

Run Time Error: This indicates that the transaction took too long to process successfully. Timeouts prevent runaway processes, damage from software bugs, and transactions so large as to be hostile to other users.

Action: Review accompanying message(s) for more information about what caused the transaction timeout. If the transaction uses custom programs, routines, or functions, they may need to be debugged.

--------------------
TPTOODEEP 
--------------------

TPTOODEEP, $TLEVEL cannot exceed 127

Run Time Error: This indicates that a TSTART attempted to initiate more concurrent subtransactions than YottaDB permits.

Action: Determine whether the transaction is implemented as designed. Modify the routine to reduce the levels of subtransaction nesting.

---------------------
TRACEON 
---------------------

TRACEON, Missing global name (with optional subscripts) to dump M-tracing information into

Compile Time Error: This indicates that no global variable was supplied on a VIEW "TRACE":1:"^gvn".

Action: Supply the global variable.

---------------------
TRACINGON
---------------------

TRACINGON, Tracing already turned on

Run Time Information: This indicates that M profiling is already turned on when a command was issued to turn tracing on.

Action: -

------------------
TRANS2BIG 
------------------

TRANS2BIG, Transaction exceeded available buffer space for region rrrr

Run Time Error: This indicates that a transaction updated more blocks than the global buffer could hold for a particular region rrrr or accessed more than the single transaction limit of 64K blocks.

Action: Look for missing TCOMMIT commands; modify the code to reduce the total content or change content of the transaction. If the transaction is as intended and the issue is the number of updates, increase the GLOBAL_BUFFERS for the region using MUPIP SET, or modify the Global Directory to redistribute the relevant globals to more regions.

----------------
TRANSMINUS 
----------------

TRANSMINUS, Negative numbers not allowed with ZTCOMMIT

Run Time Error: This indicates that a ZTCOMMIT must have a zero (0) or positive integer argument.

Action: Modify the ZTCOMMIT argument.

-----------------
TRANSNEST
-----------------

TRANSNEST, Maximum transaction nesting levels exceeded

Run Time Error: This indicates that a ZTSTART failed an attempt to establish another level of nested subtransactions.

Action: Rework the application so that it requires no more than 255 levels of journal transaction nesting.

------------
TRANSNOSTART 
------------

TRANSNOSTART, ZTCOMMIT(s) issued without corresponding ZTSTART(s)

Run Time Error: This indicates that a ZTCOMMIT specified an explicit number of ZTSTARTs to close that exceeded the number of ZSTARTs that were currently open.

Action: Use ZTCOMMIT with an argument of 0 to close all open transactions, or modify the ZTCOMMIT to use a positive integer argument that does not exceed the number of open ZTSTARTs.

----------------
TRESTLOC 
----------------

TRESTLOC, Transaction start: xxxx, Transaction failure: yyyy

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB detected a resource conflict that attempted to RESTART a transaction that did not enable RESTART. This message follows TRESTNOT error message, xxxx is the starting location for the transaction and yyyy is the point of failure.

Action: Enable RESTART with the initial TSTART command argument, or add external LOCKs to serialize the transaction.


------------------
TRESTMAX 
------------------

TRESTMAX, TRESTART not allowed in a final TP retry more than once

Run Time Error: The code contained one or more explicit TRESTART command(s) which called for a RESTART after more than once after $TRESTART reached 3. Once $TRESTART reaches 3, YottaDB switches from an optimistic to a conventional locking strategy so such restarts are expensive and potentially disruptive. Therefore YottaDB limits the ability of the application code to repeatedly demand such RESTARTs.

Action: Investigate the cause and reason(s) for the explicit restart. When combined with a subsequent TROLLBACK, explicit TRESTARTs may provide a way to manipulate the variable context and flow of control in useful ways, but other uses are unusual. If explicit TRESTARTs are appropriate, consider whether they should be conditional on the value of $TRESTART.

----------------
TRESTNOT 
----------------

TRESTNOT, Cannot TRESTART, transaction is not restartable

Run Time Error: This indicates that a TRESTART command attempted to RESTART a transaction that did not enable RESTART; the error occurs at the point of the initial TSTART, so all global updates within the transaction are rolled back and any local variables specified have their values as of the TSTART.

Action: Enable RESTART with the initial TSTART command argument, add external LOCKs to serialize the transaction, or eliminate the TRESTART command.

------------------
TRIG2NOTRIG
------------------

TRIG2NOTRIG, Sending transaction sequence number xxxx which used triggers to a replicator that does not support triggers.

MUPIP Warning: The source server encountered a transaction that includes triggers, but its replicating node does not support triggers. Unless you are using application level filters to handle this case, your originating instance and replicating instance are no longer consistent.

Action: If this case it not handled by your application level filters, you should either enhance your filters or upgrade the replicating instance to a version of YottaDB that supports triggers and load the the appropriate trigger definitions with MUPIP TRIGGER (or $ZTRIGGER()), and then take appropriate action (such as recreating the replicating instance from a backup of the originating instance) to restore consistency.

------------------
TRIGCOMPFAIL 
------------------

TRIGCOMPFAIL, Compilation of database trigger named tttt failed

Trigger/Run Time Error: The -Xecute code of a trigger specification has syntax errors. Because triggers are precompiled when you define them, this error may indicate that either:

- A database upgrade was performed but the trigger code was not updated to eliminate obsolete syntax

- The portion of the database holding the trigger definitions may be corrupted

Action: Validate the definitions by a SELECT option with MUPIP TRIGGER or $ZTRIGGER(), correct the trigger code syntax and apply a trigger update.

-------------------
TRIGDATAIGNORE 
-------------------

TRIGDATAIGNORE, Ignoring trigger data tttt. Use MUPIP TRIGGER to load trigger definitions

MUPIP Information: MUPIP LOAD displays this warning when it encounters trigger metadata during extract file processing (GO/ZWR extracts).

Action: Identify and remove trigger metadata information from GO/ZWR extract files and, if appropriate, process it with MUPIP TRIGGER or $ZTRIGGER().

----------------
TRIGDEFBAD
----------------

TRIGDEFBAD, Trigger initialization failed for global ^gggg. Error while processing ^#t("xxxx",yyyy[,zzzz])

Trigger/MUPIP Error: Missing or corrupted trigger metadata causes this error.

Action: Delete and replace defective triggers. If possible analyze the cause of the trigger damage and report the incident to your YottaDB support channel.

-----------------
TRIGDEFNOSYNC 
-----------------

TRIGDEFNOSYNC, Global ^gggg has triggers defined on the [originating/replicating] instance but none on the [replicating/originating] instance. Current journal sequence number is 0xjjjj

Update Process log/Trigger Warning: The Update Process detected that there is a mismatch in trigger definitions for global gggg between originating and replicating instances and sent this warning to the operator log.

Action: Differences in triggers between originating and replicating instances typically mean the replicating instance is not in a position to stand in as a system of record by becoming an originating instance. Unless the difference is intended because of a special use of the replicating instance, shutdown and resynchronize the replicating instance.

----------------
TRIGINVCHSET 
----------------

TRIGINVCHSET, Trigger tttt for global gggg was created with CHSET=cccc which is different from the current $ZCHSET of this process

Trigger/Run Time Error: TRIGINVCHSET occurs when a process invokes a trigger on a global using a $ZCHSET that is different from the $ZCHSET used at the time of loading the first trigger on that global. YottaDB implicitly uses the $ZCHSET of the first trigger on a global to invoke all triggers on that global. Note that tttt is the name of the first trigger on the global gggg-not necessarily the name of the trigger being invoked. cccc is the $ZCHSET of the process at the time of loading tttt on global gggg.

Action: Ensure that the process invoking a trigger on a global uses the same $ZCHSET that was used to load the first trigger on that global. If your application requires triggers in both M and UTF-8 modes, use different globals to load M mode and UTF-8 mode triggers.


-----------------
TRIGIS 
-----------------

TRIGIS, Trigger name: tttt

Trigger/Run Time Information: This message identifies a trigger name.

Action: Refer to the accompanying message(s) for more information.

--------------
TRIGLOADFAIL 
--------------

TRIGLOADFAIL, MUPIP TRIGGER or $ZTRIGGER operation failed. Failure code: xxxx

Trigger/Run Time Error: This indicates that a trigger install (using $ZTRIGGER() or MUPIP TRIGGER) encountered a database problem when it attempted to update a global variable. xxxx contains the failure codes for the four attempts as documented in section R2 of the `Maintaining Database Integrity chapter in the Administration and Operations Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/integrity.html>`_. It is very likely that the database may have integrity errors or that the process-private data structures are corrupted.

Action: Report this database error to the group responsible for database integrity at your operation

-----------------
TRIGMODINTP 
-----------------

TRIGMODINTP, Triggers for a given global cannot be both used and modified or removed in the same transaction

Run Time Error: Once a transaction has used any trigger on any node associated with a given global name (the part of the variable designation between the up-arrow (^) and the left-parenthesis ("(") (or end if there's no subscript), you cannot use that same transaction to modify definitions for any trigger associated with that global name.

Action: Rework the transaction and $ZTRIGGER() relationship to avoid this issue.


------------------
TRIGMODREGNOTRW 
------------------

TRIGMODREGNOTRW, Trigger(s) cannot be added/changed/deleted because region rrrr is read-only

Run Time Error: This error occurs when $ZTRIGGER() or MUPIP TRIGGER attempts to write to read-only region rrrr.

Action: Check for appropriate global directory mapping and appropriate permissions on the database file mapped to region rrrr.

-----------------
TRIGNAMBAD 
-----------------

TRIGNAMBAD, Trigger initialization failed. Error while processing ^#t(tttt,cccc)

Run Time/MUPIP Error: A trigger operation encountered a trigger definition for trigger with an apparent internal inconsistency while looking for characteristic cccc of type tttt.

Action: Delete and redefine the trigger in question. Consult with the group responsible for database integrity at your operation to discuss what actions might have led to this error.

----------------
TRIGNAMENF 
----------------

TRIGNAMENF, Trigger name nnnn not found with the current default global directory

Run Time/MUPIP Error: This message indicates a trigger lookup by name failed. YottaDB has a name cross reference in the default region of the current global directory. If you use multiple global directories with different default regions, trigger lookups by name, such as $ZTRIGGER(), ZBREAK and ZPRINT, only work when they use the same default region as the one in use at the time of the trigger definition.

Action: Consider using a SET $ZGBLDIR to change to an appropriate global directory when using name lookup. Also consider restructuring your global directories so they share a common default region.

-------------------
TRIGNAMEUNIQ
-------------------

TRIGNAMEUNIQ, Unable to make trigger name tttt unique beyond vvvv versions already loaded

Trigger/Run Time Error: YottaDB encountered more than vvvv different instances of the same trigger name across database regions used by the same process.

Action: Revise trigger names to prevent such a high degree of overlap.

---------------------
TRIGNOSPANGBL
---------------------

TRIGNOSPANGBL, Triggers cannot be installed/deleted for global name gggg as it spans multiple regions in current global directory

Run Time Error: This indicates that the global gggg spans multiple regions and therefore cannot have triggers installed or deleted in its name.

Action: Triggers are not currently supported for globals that span multiple regions.

----------------
TRIGREPLSTATE 
----------------

TRIGREPLSTATE, Trigger cannot update replicated database file dddd since triggering update was not replicated

Run Time Error: A process performed an update on a global in a database region which is not currently replicated, and that update invoked a trigger that, in turn, attempted an update on a global in a database region that is replicated. This would produce a journal state with insufficient information to properly recover the replicated region.

Action: Investigate whether the global directories, journaling characteristics or trigger logic need revision.

-------------------
TRIGSUBSCRANGE 
-------------------

TRIGSUBSCRANGE, Trigger definition for global ^gggg has one or more invalid subscript range(s) : ssss

YottaDB/MUPIP error: This error indicates one or more subscript range(s) of of order given the current collation subscript ordering - for global gggg in tthe trigger definition files.

Action: Verify the validity of subscript ranges in trigger definition file for the particular global, taking its collation into account, and redefine the trigger with correct subscript ranges for the collation of the global in question.

-------------------
TRIGTCOMMIT 
-------------------

TRIGTCOMMIT, TCOMMIT at $ZTLEVEL=LLLL not allowed as corresponding TSTART was done at lower $ZTLEVEL=BBBB

Trigger/Run Time Error: A TCOMMIT in trigger logic attempted to complete the active transaction that was started outside of the current trigger. Because trigger actions are atomic with the update initiating them, committing a transaction started prior to or by the triggering update cannot be committed inside the trigger.

Action: Within the trigger context, review the TCOMMIT logic to ensure that it commits only those transactions that are started within the trigger. Ensure that TCOMMIT does not attempt to commit any transaction started prior to or by the triggering update.

------------------
TRIGTLVLCHNG 
------------------

TRIGTLVLCHNG, Detected a net transaction level ($TLEVEL) change during trigger tttt. Transaction level must be the same at exit as when the trigger started

Trigger/Run Time Error: While the trigger logic can use balanced sub-transactions, it cannot cause a net change in $TLEVEL.

Action: Review the transaction management (TSTART, TCOMMIT and TROLLBACK) within trigger logic to ensure that it commits or rolls back any transactions it starts and does not attempt to commit any transaction started prior to, or by, the trigger update. You can use TROLLBACK within trigger logic to block the current transaction, possibly to write error context information. Nonetheless if you use such a TROLLBACK, YottaDB subsequently signals this error when you leave the trigger context in order to notify the process that the original triggering update has been discarded.

------------------
TRIGUPBADLABEL 
------------------

TRIGUPBADLABEL, Trigger upgrade cannot upgrade label NNNN to CCCC on ^GGGG in region RRRR

MUPIP Error: MUPIP TRIGGER UPGRADE cannot upgrade trigger version number NNNN to the current version number CCCC for the global GGGG in region RRRR.

Action: Reload the triggers in region RRRR.

---------------
TRIGZBREAKREM 
---------------

Run Time Error: Pre-allocation value of an output parameter in the external call table is greater than the maximum allowed limit (i.e. maximum string size plus one byte for terminating NULL).

Action: In the external call table, modify the pre-allocation value to less than or equal to 1,048,577.

------------------
ZCPREALLVALPAR 
------------------

ZCPREALLVALPAR, Pre-allocation allowed only for variables passed by reference

Compile Time Error: This indicates that the program specified a pre-allocation for a scalar variable passed by value.

Action: Determine if the program should use a pre-allocation or should be passed by value. If it uses a pre-allocation, the variable must be passed by reference. If the variable must be passed by value, the program cannot use a pre-allocation for that variable.

-------------------
ZCRCALLNAME 
-------------------

ZCRCALLNAME, Routine name expected but not found

Run Time Error: This indicates that the compiler encountered an open parenthesis ( indicating that parameters are listed, but found no function, which the parameters could modify.

Action: Check that the function name has been specified correctly. The function may not have been created, or the program uses an incorrect function name, or the function name may be missing.

-------------------
ZCRPARMNAME
-------------------

ZCRPARMNAME, Parameter name expected but not found

Run Time Error: This indicates that the program specified a direction and included a colon indicating that parameters would follow, but no parameters were found.

Action: The compiler indicates where the error occurred. Review the code to determine if parameters are needed or the colon should be removed.

-----------------
ZCRTENOTF 
-----------------

ZCRTENOTF, External call routine xxxx not found

Compile Time/Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB could not locate routine xxxx.

Action: Relink your external call descriptor image to include the missing routine.

----------------
ZCRTNTYP
----------------

ZCRTNTYP, Unknown return type

Compile Time Error: This indicates that the program specified an unrecognized return type. The compiler indicates where the invalid return type was found.

Action: Review the external calls table documentation for valid return types.

---------------
ZCSTATUSRET
---------------

ZCSTATUSRET, External call returned error status

Run Time Error: This indicates that the called program may contain a logic error.

Action: Review accompanying messages for more information about the cause of this error.


-----------------
ZCUNAVAIL 
-----------------

ZCUNAVAIL, Package, xxxx unavailable

Run Time Error: This indicates that the shared library may not be specified in the external call table or the path may be specified incorrectly.

Action: Verify that the external call table and the program point to the correct shared library and path.


--------------------
ZCUNKMECH 
--------------------

ZCUNKMECH, External call: Unknown parameter-passing mechanism

Run Time Error: This indicates that an external call or $ZCALL() function encountered an unsupported argument-passing MECHANISM in the external call table.

Action: Verify the spelling of the argument-passing MECHANISM values in the external call table.

------------------
ZCUNKQUAL 
------------------

ZCUNKQUAL, External call: Unknown input qualifier

Run Time Error: This indicates that the program used an invalid external call parameter.

Action: Refer to the `Programmer's Guide <https://docs.yottadb.com/ProgrammersGuide/index.html>`_ for valid external call parameters.

--------------------
ZCVECTORINDX 
--------------------

ZCVECTORINDX, Invalid Vector Index xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB can only accept positive values for vector index.

Action: Specify a valid vector index.

------------------
ZCWRONGDESC
------------------

ZCWRONGDESC, A string longer than 65535 is passed via 32-bit descriptor

Run Time Error: A string size greater than 65,535 byte was passed while the input mechanism is descriptor.

Action: Modify the external call table’s input mechanism to be descriptor64 instead of descriptor and modify the called routine to handle the new descriptor type.

------------------
ZDATEBADDATE 
------------------

ZDATEBADDATE, $ZDATE() date argument dddd is less than -365 (the $HOROLOG value for 01-JAN-1840) or greater than 364570088 (the $HOROLOG value for 31-DEC-999999)

Run Time Error: The value of the date portion of the argument dddd to $ZDATE() is outside the range of values the function handles.

Action: Examine the code that created the value of dddd for errors or revise the design to create dates within the range supported by $ZDATE().

-------------------
ZDATEBADTIME 
-------------------

ZDATEBADTIME, $ZDATE() time argument tttt is less than 0 or greater than 86399 (the $HOROLOG value for a second before midnight)

Run Time Error: The value of the time portion of the argument tttt to $ZDATE() is outside the range of values the function handles.

Action: Examine the code that created the value of tttt for errors or revise the design to create times within the range supported by $ZDATE().

ZDATEFMT 
--------------------

ZDATEFMT, $ZDATE format string contains invalid character

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ZDATE() function specified a second argument that contains one or more invalid format characters.

Action: Verify the $ZDATE() format.

-------------------
ZDIROUTOFSYNC 
-------------------

ZDIROUTOFSYNC, $ZDIRECTORY xxxx is not the same as its cached value yyyy

Run Time Warning: For performance purposes, YottaDB caches the value of $ZDIRECTORY when it is modified using SET command. This cached value is passed to external environment translation routine. YottaDB issues ZDIROUTOFSYNC error when $ZDIRECTORY is referenced and its cached value differs from the current working directory. This might happen if an external routine called from YottaDB modifies the current working directory and the application does not modify $ZDIRECTORY to the modified directory.

.. note::
   ZSHOW of intrinsic special variables appends ->%GTM-W-ZDIROUTOFSYNC error to the text corresponding to the $ZDIRECTORY if the out of sync condition is detected. 

Action: Avoid changing the current working directory except with SET $ZDIRECTORY, or ensure that SET $ZDIRECTORY is used along with the other mechanisms.

------------------
ZEDFILSPEC 
------------------

ZEDFILSPEC, Illegal ZEDIT file specification: xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that a ZEDIT command argument contains a file-specification that could not be parsed or is not a valid type for ZEDIT.

Action: Look for an attempt to edit a .o/.OBJ file.

--------------
ZFF2MANY
--------------

ZFF2MANY, Number of characters specified for ZFF deviceparameter (xxxx) is more than the allowed (yyyy)

Run Time Error: This indicates that the number of characters specified for ZFF deviceparameter for the socked device being OPENd (or USEd) exceeds the maximum allowed.

Action: Modify the string specified for ZFF to have a length of at most the maximum allowed.

---------------
ZFILENMTOOLONG 
---------------

ZFILENMTOOLONG, xxxx is longer than 255 characters

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ZFILE() function argument exceeded 255 characters. xxxx is the length of the file-specification supplied.

Action: Modify the file-specification argument.

--------------
ZFILKEYBAD
--------------

ZFILKEYBAD, xxxx is not a legal keyword for $ZFILE()

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ZFILE() function specified the invalid keyword xxxx.

Action: Review the routine for correct spelling and the validity of keywords.

-----------------
ZFILNMBAD
-----------------

ZFILNMBAD, xxxx is not a legal file name

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ZFILE() function argument supplied an invalid file-specification xxxx.

Action: Look for invalid characters or improper punctuation within the file-specification.

------------------
ZGBLDIRACC 
------------------

ZGBLDIRACC, Cannot access global directory xxxx. Continuing with yyyy.

Run Time Error: This indicates that a SET of a $ZGBLDIR or external global reference specified a Global Directory (xxxx) that does not exist or cannot be accessed due to permissions. YottaDB retains the previous Global Directory (yyyy).

Action: Ensure that you specified the intended Global Directory. Use a host shell command to verify that the specified directory exists and has the protections required for the desired access.

----------------
ZGOCALLOUTIN 
----------------

ZGOCALLOUTIN, ZGOTO level 0 with entry ref not valid when using call-ins

Call in/Run Time Error: Code invoked by a call-in contained a ZGOTO 0:entryref. The purpose of a ZGOTO 0:entryref is to "refresh" the YottaDB routine context, but that action would invalidate the interface with the calling (in) code.

Action: Refactor the code invoked by the call-in to avoid or appropriately conditionalize the ZGOTO 0:entryref.

-------------------
ZGOTOINVLVL
-------------------

ZGOTOINVLVL, ZGOTO in a trigger running in mmmm cannot ZGOTO level LLLL

MUPIP Error: A ZGOTO command in trigger logic attempted to specify an inappropriate destination. Currently that is a ZGOTO in a trigger context with a target level of one (1) and an entryref. YottaDB does not support such ZGOTO arguments in MUPIP because there is no context outside that of the trigger.

Action: Revise the trigger logic to only use ZGOTO with an entryref within the trigger context of trigger logic. Note that you can ZGOTO out of a trigger, but doing so in MUPIP terminates the MUPIP process. YottaDB recommends limiting the use of ZGOTO to debugging, error handling and testing. Use of ZGOTO in production code, even for error processing, should always be thoroughly tested.

-----------------
ZGOTOLTZERO 
-----------------

ZGOTOLTZERO, Cannot ZGOTO a level less than zero

Run Time Error: This indicates that a ZGOTO specified a negative level in its argument.

Action: Ensure that the ZGOTO level is between zero (0) and the current $ZLEVEL.

---------------
ZGOTOTOOBIG
---------------

ZGOTOTOOBIG, Cannot ZGOTO a level greater than present level

Run Time Error: This indicates that ZGOTO command specified a level greater than the current stack depth.

Action: Check the source of the level. The level argument of a ZGOTO indicates the depth the stack is to be after the ZGOTO, which cannot be greater than the current stack depth. The only way to increase stack depth is by performing DOs or XECUTEs.


------------------
ZINTDIRECT
------------------

ZINTDIRECT, Attempt to enter direct mode from $ZINTERRUPT

Run Time Error: A $ZINTERRUPT routine cannot break to direct mode if the current IO device is the same as $PRINCIPAL.

Action: Modify the $ZINTERRUPT routine to not break to direct mode.

----------------
ZINTRECURSEIO 
----------------

ZINTRECURSEIO, Attempt to do IO to the active device in $ZINTERRUPT

Run Time Error: A $ZINTERRUPT routine cannot perform I/O to the current IO device if it was active when the interrupt was recognized and the device is a terminal, socket device, FIFO, or PIPE.

Action: Modify the $ZINTERRUPT routine to not perform I/O to the active device.

----------------
ZLINKFILE
----------------

ZLINKFILE, Error while ZLINKing "xxxx"

Run Time Error: This indicates that ZLINK command failed while trying to include routine xxxx in the image.

Action: Use host shell commands to ensure that the file to be ZLINKed is in the proper directory and has the appropriate protection. Review the accompanying message(s) for additional information.

---------------
ZLMODULE 
---------------

ZLMODULE, Object file name does not match module name: xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that YottaDB did not perform a ZLINK or an auto-ZLINK because the name of the object file specified with the ZLINK xxxx is not the same as the name of the source file.

Action: Look for and correct any typographical errors in the object file specified for the ZLINK, or assign the same name to the source and object.

-----------------
ZLNOOBJECT
-----------------

ZLNOOBJECT, No object module was produced

Run Time Error: This indicates that a run-time compile specified a NOOBJECT qualifier. This can be accomplished with a ZLINK qualifier or by setting $ZCOMPILE to a qualifier string that YottaDB uses for auto-ZLINKs or ZLINKs with no qualifiers.

Action: Remove the NOOBJECT qualifier.

---------------------
ZPARSETYPE 
---------------------

ZPARSETYPE, Illegal TYPE argument to $ZPARSE(): xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ZPARSE() function specified a type argument xxxx that was not a null string, SYNTAX_ONLY, or NO_CONCEAL.

Action: Verify the spelling of the keyword.

----------------------
ZPARSFLDBAD
----------------------

ZPARSFLDBAD, Illegal $ZPARSE() field parameter: xxxx

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ZPARSE() function specified a field argument xxxx that was not NODE, DEVICE, DIRECTORY, NAME, TYPE, or VERSION.

Action: Verify that the keyword is spelled correctly.

------------------
ZPEEKNOJNLINFO
------------------

ZPEEKNOJNLINFO, $ZPEEK() unable to access requested journal structure - region rrrr is not currently journaled

Run Time Error: A $ZPEEK() invocation requested journal related information on region rrrr, but that region does not currently have journaling enabled and on. Note that if the process has not updated the database region, or used a VIEW or $VIEW() referencing the region, some fields may have a value of zero (0).

Action: Use $VIEW("JNLACTIVE",region) to determine that journaling is enabled and on for a region before attempting to access its journal-related information. 

-----------------
ZPEEKNORPLINFO
-----------------

ZPEEKNORPLINFO, $ZPEEK() unable to access requested replication structure

Run Time Error: The replication structure specified in the mnemonic is not available to this process because either replication is not running or, in the case of receive pool type requests, is not running on a non-primary where such control blocks are available.

Action: Only fetch replication values when replication is active and if accessing gtmrecv.* fields, do not run on a primary.

-------------------
ZPIDBADARG 
-------------------

ZPIDBADARG, The tvexpr must be FALSE if last $ZPID() not found

Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ZPID() function specified an argument that was TRUE when no active PID scan was in progress.

Action: Review the routine to ensure that $ZPID() is first initialized with a FALSE truth-valued expression. $ZPID() cannot be invoked with a TRUE truth-valued expression unless the last $ZPID() returned a PID. If it has not been previously invoked, it must be first invoked with a FALSE truth-valued expression.

------------------
ZPRTLABNOTFND
------------------

ZPRTLABNOTFND, Label not found in routine

Run Time Error: This indicates that a ZPRINT command specified a label that could not be found in the routine.

Action: Verify the spelling of the label. Ensure that the current version of the program has the label by ZPRINTing the entire routine.

-------------------
ZROSYNTAX
-------------------

ZROSYNTAX, $ZROUTINES syntax error: xxxx

Syntax/Run Time Error: This indicates that a $ZROUTINES related action encountered syntax error xxxx.

Action: Modify the UNIX environment variable gtmroutines or the expression being SET into $ZROUTINES.

----------------------
ZSHOWBADFUNC 
----------------------

ZSHOWBADFUNC, An illegal function was specified for ZSHOW

Run Time Error: This indicates that ZSHOW argument code specified an invalid action.

Action: Modify the argument to use a valid code.

---------------------
ZSHOWGLOSMALL
---------------------

ZSHOWGLOSMALL, Global output variable is too small for ZSHOW output

Run Time Error: This indicates that SHOW could not place data in a target global variable because the record size for the database file that holds the region containing the variable was too small to accommodate the ZSHOW output.

Action: Use a global output variable in a less restrictive region, or reorganize the database and increase the value of the qualifier RECORD_SIZE= in the Global Directory.

---------------------
ZSOCKETATTR 
---------------------

ZSOCKETATTR, Attribute "xxxx" invalid for $ZSOCKET function msg name

Run Time Error: This indicates the named attribute is not recognized for the $ZSOCKET function.

Action: Check for spelling, review the documented list of available attributes and adjust the attribute argument.

-------------------
ZSOCKETNOTSOCK 
-------------------

ZSOCKETNOTSOCK, $ZSOCKET function called but device is not a socket

Run Time Error: The code invoked the $ZSOCKET() function with a device which is not a Socket Device.

Action: Review device usage and revise as appropriate.

--------------------
ZSRCHSTRMCT 
--------------------

ZSRCHSTRMCT, Search stream identifier out of range

Run Time Error: This indicates that $ZSEARCH() function specified a stream less than 1 or greater than 255.

Action: Change the stream value to be within the range of 1-255.

-------------------
ZSTEPARG 
-------------------

ZSTEPARG, ZSTEP argument expected

Compile Time Error: This indicates that ZSTEP command did not specify an argument or a <SP> to hold the place of the missing argument.

Action: Modify the ZSTEP command so it has an argument or a trailing double space.

-----------------
ZTRIGINVACT
-----------------

ZTRIGINVACT, Missing or invalid subcode (first) parameter given to $ZTRIGGER()

Trigger/Run Time Error: The first argument to $ZTRIGGER() is required to specify its mode of action.

Action: for the first argument of $ZTRIGGER() use an expression that evaluates to "FILE", "ITEM" or "SELECT".

------------------
ZTRIGNOTP 
------------------

ZTRIGNOTP, $ZTRIGGER() cannot use update subcodes FILE or ITEM when a TP transaction is in progress ($TLEVEL greater than zero)

Trigger/Run Time Error: A FILE or ITEM operation of $ZTRIGGER() failed because it attempted to apply a trigger definition inside an ongoing transaction. Both FILE and ITEM operations of $ZTRIGGER initiate an implicit transaction to achieve trigger update atomicity, therefore, YottaDB does not allow nesting them inside another transaction that potentially might use the very triggers $ZTRIGGER() is attempting to update.

Action: Move all FILE or ITEM operations of $ZTRIGGER() outside the scope of any open transaction.

--------------------
ZTRIGNOTRW 
--------------------

ZTRIGNOTRW, ZTRIGGER cannot operate on read-only region rrrr

Run Time Error: This error occurs when ZTRIGGER attempts to write to read-only region rrrr.

Action: Check for appropriate global directory mapping and appropriate permissions on the database file mapped to region rrrr.

-------------------
ZTWORMHOLE2BIG 
-------------------

ZTWORMHOLE2BIG, String length of LLLL bytes exceeds maximum length of mmmm bytes for $ZTWORMHOLE

Trigger/Run Time Error: YottaDB limits $ZTWORMHOLE length to mmmm bytes and the application attempted to use LLLL bytes.

Action: Restrict the size of the string stored in $ZTWORMHOLE to mmmm bytes. Ensure that $ZTWORMHOLE only holds the information that the application needs during trigger execution. If necessary, reorganize the logic to reduce the amount of local context needed during trigger execution, possibly by using global variables.

--------------------
ZWRSPONE 
--------------------

ZWRSPONE, Subscript patterns in ZWRITE are atomic; Invalid delimiter

Compile Time Error: This indicates that ZWRITE specification contained a pattern match that held or terminated with a punctuation character that was not within a string literal.

Action: Look for missing quotes or typographical errors and make any corrections that are necessary.
